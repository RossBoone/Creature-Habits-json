    "Interview Text": "Healing or Talking:\n\nOne day a friend said he said he wanted to take a trip to Kansas City (or some other city a couple hours away) and just see if we can find some people who need healing. \n\nIt turned out we met a man waiting at a crosswalk with us who had just had a fight with his wife and he had left to think about things. He was considering just getting into his car and driving away from it all forever. \n\nMy friend kept asking if he had any pains in his body that we could try to heal, but I felt that this guy just needs emotional healing. He needs to talk and be heard and be ministered to in that way. I felt that it was his heart that was sick. \n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
