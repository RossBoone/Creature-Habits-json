And afterwards he said it was as he expected. Just like another of his friend's journals and like his own, God's voice sounded the same. When he had a message for them it almost always sounded like something a very good father would say to his four year old. Just very simple and very loving. Like, \"You are enough.\" \"I love you so much.\" And \"It's okay. You can just rest in my love. I'm here. You can trust me.\"\n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
