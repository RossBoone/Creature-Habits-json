    "famous quote": "\"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\"\n-- C.S. Lewis",

    "Interview Text": "More Stories from Kevin:\n\nWhen I asked Kevin about these stories he said it's funny you should ask about it today because at church today the pastor said in Corinthians Paul says prophecy should be sought for everyone because it helps us lift each other up. \n\nThis isn't definitive proof of God or anything but one time recently he had been struggling with back pain so much that there were days he couldn't go into work. He had gotten physical therapy and was even wearing a back brace when he went to Nick's house, under his shirt and under his jacket where Nick couldn't have been able to see it. Nick didn't know Kevin had been having back pain. \n\nNick started randomly talking about how he had been having back pain and he found a solution online which instructed to lay on a tennis ball and roll it around under your back until you get knots out. He ended by saying, I don't why I just told you all that.\n\nKevin said, well that's funny because I've been having really bad back pain too. Kevin tried the tennis ball method and his back got better. \n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
