    "Interview Text": "When you Don't See Miracles:\n\nBut what if He doesn't come? Will all those hours on my knees be in vain, delaying my work because I think if I seek him first everything will still get done?\r\n\nMaybe God's movement would be most effective to people in the form of just letting them feel known. Not as a copout to seeing God work, but maybe hearing words that God gives us to speak to others, more often than physical healing.  \r\n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
