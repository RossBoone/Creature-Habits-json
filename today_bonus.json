    "famous quote": "If you don't understand, ask questions. If you're uncomfortable about asking questions, say you are uncomfortable about asking questions and then ask anyway. It's easy to tell when a question is coming from a good place. Then listen some more. Sometimes people just want to feel heard. Here's to possibilities of friendship and connection and understanding.\n-Ngozi Adichie (in \"Americanah\")",

    "Interview Text": "More Stories from Kevin: \n\nThen one of his Alcoholics Anonymous friends confessed to Kevin that he had been having such bad anxiety lately that he was just glad he had a good life insurance policy so his kids would be taken care of if he died. He pulled a package of Xanax out of his pocket. His doctor had given it to him so he could take it during a panic attack to prevent his heart from stopping, but Xanax is indulgently called Xandy bars by addicts because it gives a high and that would be a time bomb for his sobriety.\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous teaches that to get over your addiction you must stay active in positive things. He had hit a similar wall earlier and through counseling had discovered a technique to get healthy. It was simply planning two days each week that were off limits to planning anything with anybody, and on which he must rest. Kevin's friend's confession was supremely timed and Kevin was able to share what he had learned. \n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
