    "Interview Text": "Martin:\n\n(part 2)\n\nNow, the most important part of how the Lord speaks to me.\r\n\nIf you read a little earlier in 1 Kings, you realize Elijah is crying out to God. He is praying. He has gotten scared, depressed, basically overwhelmed, and feels desperate. God tells him to go to the mountain.\n\r\nGet by yourself.\r\nGod tells him to wait and he will pass by.\r\nWait for the Lord to visit.\r\n \r\nWhen I do the following:\r\n \r\nGet up early before everyone else.\r\nGo sit on the porch or by the fire.\r\nRead the Bible.\r\nPray for an extended period.\r\n                        I write out my prayers\r\n                                    Praise\r\n                                    Confess\r\n                                    Thanks\r\n                                    Request\r\n \r\nIt is amazing what the Lord tells me. It is rarely audible, but it is, in new and different ideas. Things I would have never thought of. Ideas that could only have come from God. This is how the Lord speaks to me. When I need the Lord to tell me what to do, this is the way I get help.",
