    "famous quote": "\"Here I am going to say something which may come as a bit of a shock. God doesn't necessarily want us to be happy. He wants us to be lovable. Worthy of love. Able to be loved by Him. We don't start off being all that lovable, if we're honest. What makes people hard to love? Isn't it what is commonly called selfishness? Selfish people are hard to love because so little love comes out of them.\"\n-- William Nicholson (Shadowlands)",

    "User added": "\"For he is our God; we are the people of his pasture, the sheep he owns. Today, if only you would obey him!\"\n??Psalms? ?95:7? ?NET??????\n\nThe verses following this one tell how the people of Israel were obstinate in not trusting God to take care of them. When you think of God, what first comes to mind? Love? Grace? Mercy? Or, does God's judgment pop up first? Certainly, God has all of these attributes and more, to perfection. But when it comes to you, do you really trust God to do what is best for you?\n\n\"For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\"\n??John? ?3:16? ?NET??????\n\n-Sean Lennon",

    "Interview Text": "Matthias:\n\n(part 5)\n\n\"I can give you some examples,\" Matthias says.\n\nMatthias had approached a children's pastor when he was seeking advice. He had asked her how she knew she was called to ministry. She gave him some advice and then said, if you'd like to try children's ministry, come help us out. So he began helping there regularly. He'd serve on Wednesdays usually, and sometimes on Tuesdays. One Tuesday he was riding Marta back to Midtown. He thought, tomorrow I'm looking forward to going back and seeing the kids. But he felt a very clear voice say, \"Don't go tomorrow.\" \nHe was surprised and thought, \"That's ministry. Why shouldn't I go?\"\nBut he obeyed and called her. She said, \"Okay, if it was from the Lord, that's what you should do!\"\nThen right when he got home, he received a message from someone in his house church who said, \"I feel like I'm being attacked by demons. Can you come by?\"\nHe told her he was now free tomorrow and she was eager to have him come.\nHe was able to minister to her because he was available. ",
