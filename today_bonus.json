    "famous quote": "\"The great thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one's 'own,' or 'real' life. The truth is of course that what one calls the interruptions are precisely one's real life -- the life God is sending one day by day.\"\n-- C.S. Lewis (The Collected Works of C.S. Lewis)",

    "Interview Text": "\"The Circle Maker,\" my Mark Batterson\n\nI'm reading the Circle Maker, by Mark Batterson. What he says is to define exactly what you think God is leading you to pray for, and then pray powerfully for it. He tells how he felt like he should walk prayer circles around the plot of land that he wanted for his church and he got it. He says be specific with your request so God can be pleased to answer it specifically.\n\nIt's not that we want to be Charismatic. We just want to be what God wants the church to be. And this is what was happening in his church. This is what Jesus said we would do. See visions, work miracles. Help the poor.\n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
