    "Interview Text": "Chris:\n\n(part 2)\n\nOn his long drive out to the interview he decided he should stop at a grocery store to at least get some toothpaste to freshen up after sleeping at his friend's house. In the store he sees a man in a wheel chair that is wearing a hat backwards that says \"I (heart) Jesus\". And Chris started a conversation with him. Then he asked if he could pray for his legs. The man said sure and over the next 30 minutes every time they prayed the man who hadn't been able to move his leg at all in ten years was able to move it a little more, until he could fully extend it. It turned out he hadn't been able to move his arm either and it also had much more mobility. Chris gave him his phone number and said he had to get to an interview.  By the time he left  the man was able to stand up. ",
