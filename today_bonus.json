    "Interview Text": "From a conversation with a girl named Crystal on a plane:\n\nShe had a wickan friend and they did a ouiji board together. And they summoned a spirit. and it would inhabit each of them. She said it felt like her chest felt like it was going to explode. And she couldn't control her emotions. It made her scream, and cry and growl. her wickan friend had to excorsize it and take it into herself. But then she was haunted by it for a week. they had to excorsize her house twice and some other stuff before they finally got it to leave.\n\nThis just reminds me that the spiritual realm is real. ",
