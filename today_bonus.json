    "Interview Text": "Healing on a Plane: \n\nI have a friend who I haven't talked to in a long time. He was really into faith healing. He told me a story that on a plane one time, when they had landed and people were getting ready to get off, he felt like someone's knee was in pain or had something wrong with it. So he said where everybody in the vicinity could hear, does someone here have a hurt knee? I feel like someone here has a problem with their knee. After everybody got off someone stopped him and said, it's strange but yes, I do have a knee problem. He said, can I pray for it? They said yes, and they were healed. And I think he led them to Christ right then. \n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
