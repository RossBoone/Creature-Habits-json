    "Interview Text": "The American Version of Healing:\n\nWhen I got back from Ethiopia I had a voice mail from a friend named Adriene about being a part of her ministry, FCA in which she orchestrates soccer teams for the underprivileged youth of Atlanta. Anyway when I called her back, near the end of our conversation I told her about the project and asked if she had any thoughts on how God works in America. \r\nShe told me how she had seen God in her life. She had struggled with severe anxiety. But she had a miraculous freedom by reading \"The Bondage Breaker\" by Niel Anderson. It taught her to recognize what she was fearing and then that she could trust that Christ was in control. And really believing that is what healed her from it.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is more the American style: using the mind God gave us to research and write and read books to help each other understand God's words to us.\r\n\n-Raw Spoon",
