    "Interview Text": "Hannah Noble:\n\n(part 10)\n\nShe remembers moments in their old \"Yellow House? when they were going through the church difficulties. She said, \"It was a good place to be, but it was very hollow. God met us there, but it was sort of like a shanty in the desert. When everything was going so badly, my daughter woke up several times to nightmares. I walked into her nursery several times, feeling a bad presence. And I would wake up and feel something moving up my leg, and it wasn?t David.? \n\nShe said, ?The reality is that I can?t be touched because the Lord had given me that identification. I think through my story, and I think if people really understand that who they are is intricately wired as sonship or daughtership of the most high, they wouldn?t be afraid.?\n",
