    "Interview Text": "More Stories from Kevin:\n\n\"Also, one time I had been praying and writing some stuff in my prayer journal. Nick had also been praying and wrote down what he had heard in regards to me. I jotted them down, making sure I had the exact words. I didn't know if they would really have any meaning. The next day God said something like, 'What Nick said is what you heard me tell you.' I checked the stuff I had written in my journal a few days before and the phrases had remarkable similarities.\"\r\n\nKevin sent me the picture of a sheet with what Nick spoke over him sitting next to Kevin's journal, with the similar phrases highlighted. Below on the left is what Nick had told him, and on the right is what he had written in his own journal. \r\n\nStand tall\t --  Stand tall\r\nAlready equipped  --  Go do what I have made you to do.  You are good at it and well-equipped\r\nWake up  --  Awake from your slumber\r\nCome to me  --  Follow me\r\nI made you a man --  You are a very good man\r\n\r\nKevin realized God was saying something like, 'I've been trying to tell you this for two weeks. This is how I am trying to get you to listen.'\n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)\r\n",
