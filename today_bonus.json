    "Interview Text": "I ran into one of my Pastors, Chris and I told him a bit about my trip to Ethiopia. I asked him about our church's views on miracles. He said we are definitely not against it. I just don't think we've had it come up here yet. And then he said, \"You know, an amazing book on the subject is Power Evangelism by John Winber.\" I told him that was the same guy that a couple other people had told me about. Our church had actually been started out of the Vineyard movement, which John Winber had founded.\r\n\nChris said that John thinks that signs of God are the main way evangelism is supposed to happen. Chris said it was a short and easy read. And I guess I learned from Adrienne God can speak through books.\n\n-Raw Spoon\n(from Miracles in America)",
