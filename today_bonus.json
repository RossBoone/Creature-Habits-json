    "Interview Text": "Gloria's Story:\n\nI sat next to Gloria on a plane back to Colorado for Christmas and we talked the whole time. She told me that she heard God very clearly one time in her life. It was a long time ago when her husband had moved to Georgia to be with her and now she felt he was mad at her for it because it was hard finding a job down there and things were hard. \r\n\n\"I was lying next to my husband praying about what to do. I would pray each night, but my husband doesn't really pray much. And I heard very clearly, \"Who do you think brought you here?\"\r\n\n\"It wasn't like a voice in my ears,\" She motioned to her ears. \"I felt it inside.\" She patted her stomach, still not sure how to describe where she felt it. \"It was after I had told everything to God and I stopped speaking. That's when I heard it. It was so peaceful. It was quiet.\"",
