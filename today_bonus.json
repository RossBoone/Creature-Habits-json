    "Interview Text": "Tesfaye Tesema Haylemarian\nOx comes to life after its throat is cut.\nInterview (part 3)\n\nAnother story. My brother had an ox and one day his ox died in the middle of the mud. To preserve the ox meat they have to slaughter it and make the blood come out. So he cut the neck and let the blood come out. But since he was alone he could not pull the ox out of the mud. So he came to me to help him take it out. \r\n\r\nI said okay. When I arrived his wife was crying because the ox means everything for them. They couldn't farm anymore. I said I will pray for the ox and he will come alive. My brother laughed and said I already bled it out. If this ox comes to life I will give my life to Christ.\r\nI knelt down and prayed for the ox and when I stood up the ox stood up. And my brother came to Christ. \r\nThen they fixed the skin of the Ox's neck with medicine, and a while later they were able to sell the ox for good money because it was alive.\r\n",
