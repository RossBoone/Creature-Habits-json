    "famous quote": "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccesssful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derlicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan press on' has solved and always will solv ethe problems of hte human race. \n-Calvin Coolidge",

    "Interview Text": "Thor Colberg\nMiracles in America\nInterview (part 4)\n\nHow do you make sure you're plugged in to hear God?\n\r\nAsk, \"Father, what are you doing? And how can I take part in what you're doing?\"\r\nDon't say, \"Bless what I'm doing.\" Instead ask, \"Where are you moving, and how can I be a part?\"\r\nDo a lot of worship. Develop your secret history with God. Go to Starbucks and have a cup of coffee with Jesus. Put your headphones with worship music on and have your Bible there in case he tells you to turn to something. And listen to him. Don't ask for God's power. Don't you just want Jesus? \r\nSome people ask, \"Thor, how's your ministry doing?\" and I say, \"I don't have a ministry, I get to take part in the ministry of Jesus. It's His ministry.\"\r\nNot one of you has a ministry. We get invited to be a part of His ministry. The secret of the kingdom is THE KING.\r\n\nHe pauses while I am writing, until another thought comes to him.\r\n\nThere is a difference between your calling and His ministry. He's our leader. We each have a calling, but we don't have a ministry. We get to take part in His ministry. And His is exciting. I want to be a part of His ministry. I want to be saying what the Father is saying and doing what the Father is doing. \r\nAs N.T. Wright says, \"I'm a kingdom bringer.\"\r\n",
