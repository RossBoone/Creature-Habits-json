    "Interview Text": "Last Story from Kevin: \n\nThen there was the time I got cancer. It started when I went in to the doctor for a lump on my testicle. They told me it was probably just an inflammation but I left there with a cancer diagnosis. \r\nI got into my car and cried. But then a voice, inaudible but coming from my right side said, \"This will not be the end of you.\" It was so powerful and real that I believed it. Even after they operated to remove it and it reappeared in my other testicle years later, I was still the person consoling others. I was okay through the whole process because I believed God said that it would not take me.\r\n\r\nAmong my friends, Kevin has had the most bruised past. Most sinful and unhealthy and closest to death. And he has also had the most miraculous deliverance and interaction with God. Kevin said he felt hesitant to say it like this, but that he was grateful he had been given the \"gift of alcoholism.\" Like the people in Ethiopia, without the desperation and need for help outside of ourselves, we don't rely on faith.\r\n\n-Raw Spoon (from Miracles in America)",
