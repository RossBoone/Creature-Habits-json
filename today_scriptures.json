    "Script 1": "\nPsalm [a]\n\nא Aleph\n\n Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,\n    who walk according to the law of the Lord.\n Blessed are those who keep his statutes\n    and seek him with all their heart--\n they do no wrong\n    but follow his ways.\n You have laid down precepts\n    that are to be fully obeyed.\n Oh, that my ways were steadfast\n    in obeying your decrees!\n Then I would not be put to shame\n    when I consider all your commands.\n I will praise you with an upright heart\n    as I learn your righteous laws.\n I will obey your decrees;\n    do not utterly forsake me.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.  For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.\n\n But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,  I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.\n\n This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live  and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the Lord is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",
    "Script 3": "The Church and Its Leaders\n\n Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly--mere infants in Christ.  I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.  You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?  For when one says, \"I follow Paul,\" and another, \"I follow Apollos,\" are you not mere human beings?\n\n What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.  I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.  So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.  The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.  For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building.",
    "Script 4": "\nMurder\n\n \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder,[a] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'  But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister[b][c] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,'[d] is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.\n\n \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,  leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.\n\n \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.  Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.\n\nAdultery\n\n \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'[e]  But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n\nDivorce\n\n \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'[f]  But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\nOaths\n\n \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.'  But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne;  or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.  All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.[g]\n\n",
