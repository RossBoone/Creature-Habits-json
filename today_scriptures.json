And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.  And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that [e]I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.  And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.\n\n Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.  He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is [f]besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.
