    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. According to alamoth.[b] A song.\n\n God is our refuge and strength,\n    an ever-present help in trouble.\n Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way\n    and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,\n though its waters roar and foam\n    and the mountains quake with their surging.[c]\n\n There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,\n    the holy place where the Most High dwells.\n God is within her, she will not fall;\n    God will help her at break of day.\n Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;\n    he lifts his voice, the earth melts.\n\n The Lord Almighty is with us;\n    the God of Jacob is our fortress.\n\n Come and see what the Lord has done,\n    the desolations he has brought on the earth.\n He makes wars cease\n    to the ends of the earth.\nHe breaks the bow and shatters the spear;\n    he burns the shields[d] with fire.\n He says, \"Be still, and know that I am God;\n    I will be exalted among the nations,\n    I will be exalted in the earth.\"\n\n The Lord Almighty is with us;\n    the God of Jacob is our fortress.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, \"Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.\"\n\n But Micaiah said, \"As surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what my God says.\"\n\n When he arrived, the king asked him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?\"\n\n\"Attack and be victorious,\" he answered, \"for they will be given into your hand.\"\n\n The king said to him, \"How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?\"\n\n Then Micaiah answered, \"I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'\"\n\n The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?\"\n\n Micaiah continued, \"Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left.  And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'\n\n\"One suggested this, and another that.  Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, 'I will entice him.'\n\n\"'By what means?' the Lord asked.\n\n \"'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said.\n\n\"'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'\n\n \"So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.\"",
    "Script 3": " It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.  Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.  Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.  Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,  so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.  And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
