    "Script 3": "The Parable of the Ten Minas\n\n While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.  He said: \"A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.  So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.[a] 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'\n\n \"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'\n\n \"He was made king, however, and returned home.

'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'\n\n \"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'\n\n \"His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'\n\n \"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.  I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'\n\n \"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?  Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'\n\n \"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'\n\n \"'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'\n\n \"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.  But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'\"\n\n",

    "Script 1": "Psalm \n\nA psalm of Asaph.\n\n The Mighty One, God, the Lord,\n    speaks and summons the earth\n    from the rising of the sun to where it sets.\n From Zion, perfect in beauty,\n    God shines forth.\n Our God comes\n    and will not be silent;\na fire devours before him,\n    and around him a tempest rages.\n He summons the heavens above,\n    and the earth, that he may judge his people:\n \"Gather to me this consecrated people,\n    who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.\"\n And the heavens proclaim his righteousness,\n    for he is a God of justice.[a][b]\n\n \"Listen, my people, and I will speak;\n    I will testify against you, Israel:\n    I am God, your God.\n I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices\n    or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.\n I have no need of a bull from your stall\n    or of goats from your pens,\n for every animal of the forest is mine,\n    and the cattle on a thousand hills.\n I know every bird in the mountains,\n    and the insects in the fields are mine.\n If I were hungry I would not tell you,\n    for the world is mine, and all that is in it.\n Do I eat the flesh of bulls\n    or drink the blood of goats?\n\n \"Sacrifice thank offerings to God,\n    fulfill your vows to the Most High,\n and call on me in the day of trouble;\n    I will deliver you, and you will honor me.\"\n\n But to the wicked person, God says:\n\n\"What right have you to recite my laws\n    or take my covenant on your lips?\n You hate my instruction\n    and cast my words behind you.\n When you see a thief, you join with him;\n    you throw in your lot with adulterers.\n You use your mouth for evil\n    and harness your tongue to deceit.\n You sit and testify against your brother\n    and slander your own mother's son.\n When you did these things and I kept silent,\n    you thought I was exactly[c] like you.\nBut I now arraign you\n    and set my accusations before you.\n\n \"Consider this, you who forget God,\n    or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:\n Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me,\n    and to the blameless[d] I will show my salvation.\"\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Amos :-\n\n For I know how many are your offenses\n    and how great your sins.\n\nThere are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes\n    and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.\n Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times,\n    for the times are evil.\n\n Seek good, not evil,\n    that you may live.\nThen the Lord God Almighty will be with you,\n    just as you say he is.\n Hate evil, love good;\n    maintain justice in the courts.\nPerhaps the Lord God Almighty will have mercy\n    on the remnant of Joseph.\n\n Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says:\n\n\"There will be wailing in all the streets\n    and cries of anguish in every public square.\nThe farmers will be summoned to weep\n    and the mourners to wail.\n There will be wailing in all the vineyards,\n    for I will pass through your midst,\"\nsays the Lord.\n\nThe Day of the Lord\n\n Woe to you who long\n    for the day of the Lord!\nWhy do you long for the day of the Lord?\n    That day will be darkness, not light.\n It will be as though a man fled from a lion\n    only to meet a bear,\nas though he entered his house\n    and rested his hand on the wall\n    only to have a snake bite him.\n Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light--\n    pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?\n\n \"I hate, I despise your religious festivals;\n    your assemblies are a stench to me.\n Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings,\n    I will not accept them.\nThough you bring choice fellowship offerings,\n    I will have no regard for them.\n Away with the noise of your songs!\n    I will not listen to the music of your harps.\n But let justice roll on like a river,\n    righteousness like a never-failing stream!",
    "Script 3": "Luke :-\n\nThe Parable of the Ten Minas\n\n While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.  He said: \"A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.  So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.[a] 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'\n\n \"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'\n\n \"He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.\n\n \"The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'\n\n \"'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'\n\n \"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'\n\n \"His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'\n\n \"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.  I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'\n\n \"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?  Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'\n\n \"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'\n\n \"'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'\n\n \"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.  But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'\"\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Esther :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,  and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,  and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,  the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.\n\n On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.  And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.  Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.  And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.  And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.  And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.\n\n This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.",
