    "Script 2": " Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.  All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it.\n\n \"'As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them.  They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies.  You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.  Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their ancestors' sins they will waste away.\n\n \"'But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors--their unfaithfulness and their hostility toward me,  which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies--then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin,  I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.  For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees.  Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the Lord their God.  But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the Lord.'\"\n\n These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the Lord established at Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.",
    "Script 3": " Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.  Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.\n\n Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister[a] is still in the darkness.  Anyone who loves their brother and sister[b] lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.  But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.\n\nReasons for Writing\n\n I am writing to you, dear children,\n    because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.\n I am writing to you, fathers,\n    because you know him who is from the beginning.\nI am writing to you, young men,\n    because you have overcome the evil one.\n\n I write to you, dear children,\n    because you know the Father.\nI write to you, fathers,\n    because you know him who is from the beginning.\nI write to you, young men,\n    because you are strong,\n    and the word of God lives in you,\n    and you have overcome the evil one.\n\nOn Not Loving the World\n\n Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father[c] is not in them.  For everything in the world--the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life--comes not from the Father but from the world.
