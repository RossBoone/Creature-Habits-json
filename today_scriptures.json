    "Script 2": " indeed, wine betrays him;\n    he is arrogant and never at rest.\nBecause he is as greedy as the grave\n    and like death is never satisfied,\nhe gathers to himself all the nations\n    and takes captive all the peoples.\n\n \"Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying,\n\n\"'Woe to him who piles up stolen goods\n    and makes himself wealthy by extortion!\n    How long must this go on?'\n Will not your creditors suddenly arise?\n    Will they not wake up and make you tremble?\n    Then you will become their prey.\n Because you have plundered many nations,\n    the peoples who are left will plunder you.\nFor you have shed human blood;\n    you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.\n\n \"Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,\n    setting his nest on high\n    to escape the clutches of ruin!\n You have plotted the ruin of many peoples,\n    shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.\n The stones of the wall will cry out,\n    and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.",
    "Script 3": "Faith in the Incarnate Son of God\n\n Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.  This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.  In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,  for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.  Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\nConcluding Affirmations\n\n I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.  This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.  And if we know that he hears us--whatever we ask--we know that we have what we asked of him.\n\n If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.  All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.\n\n We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.  We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.  We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.\n\n Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.",

And these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.  And the Levites shall answer, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,\n\n Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.\n\n Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
