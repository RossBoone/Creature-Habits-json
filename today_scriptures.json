    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. A psalm of David.\n\n May the Lord answer you when you are in distress;\n    may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.\n May he send you help from the sanctuary\n    and grant you support from Zion.\n May he remember all your sacrifices\n    and accept your burnt offerings.[b]\n May he give you the desire of your heart\n    and make all your plans succeed.\n May we shout for joy over your victory\n    and lift up our banners in the name of our God.\n\nMay the Lord grant all your requests.\n\n Now this I know:\n    The Lord gives victory to his anointed.\nHe answers him from his heavenly sanctuary\n    with the victorious power of his right hand.\n Some trust in chariots and some in horses,\n    but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.\n They are brought to their knees and fall,\n    but we rise up and stand firm.\n Lord, give victory to the king!\n    Answer us when we call!\n\n",
    "Script 2": " At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, \"Ask for whatever you want me to give you.\"\n\n Solomon answered, \"You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.\n\n \"Now, Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.  Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number.  So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?\"\n\n The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.  So God said to him, \"Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice,  I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.  Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for--both wealth and honor--so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.  And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.\"",
    "Script 3": "Dispute Over Jesus' Testimony\n\n When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\"\n\n The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.  You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.  But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.  In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.  I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\"\n\n Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\"\n\n\"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\"",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which [a]is among the trees of the forest?  Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?  Behold, when it was whole, it was [b]meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be [c]meet for any work!  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so [d]will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  And I will set my face against them; they [e]shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n \n",
