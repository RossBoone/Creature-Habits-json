    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. Of David.

    "Script 2": "The Call of Elisha\n\n So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.  Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.\"\n\n\"Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\"\n\n So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.",
    "Script 3": "Jesus Calls His First Disciples\n\n One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,[a] the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.  He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.  He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.\n\n When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.\"\n\n Simon answered, \"Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\"\n\n When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.  So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.\n\n When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, \"Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\"  For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,  and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.\n\nThen Jesus said to Simon, \"Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.\"  So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!  For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.  And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.  [a]Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of [b]the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.\n\n Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: [c]from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.  And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are [d]destroyed.  In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.\n\n Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.  And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and [e]all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the [f]images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.  And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.  And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries [g]in the day-time.  The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall [h]withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.  Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.\n\n \n",

For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.  And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.  [a]Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of [b]the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.\n\n Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: [c]from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.  And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are [d]destroyed.  In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.\n\n Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.  And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and [e]all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the [f]images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.  And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.  And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries [g]in the day-time.  The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall [h]withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.  Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.\n\n \n",
