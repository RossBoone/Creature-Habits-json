    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. According to sheminith.[b] A psalm of David.\n\n Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;\n    those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.\n Everyone lies to their neighbor;\n    they flatter with their lips\n    but harbor deception in their hearts.\n\n May the Lord silence all flattering lips\n    and every boastful tongue--\n those who say,\n    \"By our tongues we will prevail;\n    our own lips will defend us--who is lord over us?\"\n\n \"Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,\n    I will now arise,\" says the Lord.\n    \"I will protect them from those who malign them.\"\n And the words of the Lord are flawless,\n    like silver purified in a crucible,\n    like gold[c] refined seven times.\n\n You, Lord, will keep the needy safe\n    and will protect us forever from the wicked,\n who freely strut about\n    when what is vile is honored by the human race.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Better a dry crust with peace and quiet\n    than a house full of feasting, with strife.\n\n A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son\n    and will share the inheritance as one of the family.\n\n The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold,\n    but the Lord tests the heart.\n\n A wicked person listens to deceitful lips;\n    a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.\n\n Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker;\n    whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished.",
    "Script 3": "Paul's Use of His Freedom\n\n Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.  To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.  To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law.  To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.  I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.",
