    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents. Of David.\n\n I rejoiced with those who said to me,\n    \"Let us go to the house of the Lord.\"\n Our feet are standing\n    in your gates, Jerusalem.\n\n Jerusalem is built like a city\n    that is closely compacted together.\n That is where the tribes go up--\n    the tribes of the Lord--\nto praise the name of the Lord\n    according to the statute given to Israel.\n There stand the thrones for judgment,\n    the thrones of the house of David.\n\n Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:\n    \"May those who love you be secure.\n May there be peace within your walls\n    and security within your citadels.\"\n For the sake of my family and friends,\n    I will say, \"Peace be within you.\"\n For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,\n    I will seek your prosperity.",
    "Script 2": " Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.  God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.  So God said to Noah, \"I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.  So make yourself an ark of cypress[a] wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.  This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.[b]  Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit[c] high all around.[d] Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.  I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.  But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.  You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.  Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.  You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\"\n\n Noah did everything just as God commanded him.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times\n\n Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.  \"Do you see all these things?\" he asked. \"Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\"\n\n As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. \"Tell us,\" they said, \"when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\"\n\n Jesus answered: \"Watch out that no one deceives you.  For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many.  You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.  Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.  All these are the beginning of birth pains.\n\n \"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.  At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,  and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.  Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,  but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.  And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n\n \"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,'[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand--  then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.  Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house.  Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.  How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!  Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.  For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again.\n\n \"If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.  And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.  And Joshua [a]discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in [b]a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: [c]that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it [d]Jehovah-nissi;  and he said, [e]Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n \n",
