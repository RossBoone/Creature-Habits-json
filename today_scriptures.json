    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents.\n\n I lift up my eyes to the mountains--\n    where does my help come from?\n My help comes from the Lord,\n    the Maker of heaven and earth.\n\n He will not let your foot slip--\n    he who watches over you will not slumber;\n indeed, he who watches over Israel\n    will neither slumber nor sleep.\n\n The Lord watches over you--\n    the Lord is your shade at your right hand;\n the sun will not harm you by day,\n    nor the moon by night.\n\n The Lord will keep you from all harm--\n    he will watch over your life;\n the Lord will watch over your coming and going\n    both now and forevermore.",
    "Script 2": " Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.  He instructed them: \"This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.  I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'\"\n\n When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, \"We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.\"\n\n In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,[a] and the flocks and herds and camels as well.  He thought, \"If Esau comes and attacks one group,[b] the group[c] that is left may escape.\"\n\n Then Jacob prayed, \"O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'  I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.  Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.  But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'\"\n\n He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:  two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.  He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, \"Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.\"\n\n He instructed the one in the lead: \"When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'  then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'\"\n\n He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: \"You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.  And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'\" For he thought, \"I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.\"  So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight\n\n Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means \"son of Timaeus\"), was sitting by the roadside begging.  When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\"\n\n Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\"\n\n Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\"\n\nSo they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\"  Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.\n\n \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him.\n\nThe blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\"\n\n \"Go,\" said Jesus, \"your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.  Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?  And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.  Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.  For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.  I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.  [a]There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.\n\n \n",
