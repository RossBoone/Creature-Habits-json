    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.\n\n Have mercy on me, O God,\n    according to your unfailing love;\naccording to your great compassion\n    blot out my transgressions.\n Wash away all my iniquity\n    and cleanse me from my sin.\n\n For I know my transgressions,\n    and my sin is always before me.\n Against you, you only, have I sinned\n    and done what is evil in your sight;\nso you are right in your verdict\n    and justified when you judge.\n Surely I was sinful at birth,\n    sinful from the time my mother conceived me.\n Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;\n    you taught me wisdom in that secret place.\n\n Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;\n    wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.\n Let me hear joy and gladness;\n    let the bones you have crushed rejoice.\n Hide your face from my sins\n    and blot out all my iniquity.\n\n Create in me a pure heart, O God,\n    and renew a steadfast spirit within me.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.  And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.  Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,  male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.  And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.\n\nGenesis :-\n\n But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.  Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.  The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,  and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.  The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.",
    "Script 3": "False Teachers and Their Destruction\n\n But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.  Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.  In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.\n\n For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[a] putting them in chains of darkness[b] to be held for judgment;  if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;  if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;  and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless  (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--  if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.  This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh[c] and despise authority.\n\nBold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings;\n\n",
