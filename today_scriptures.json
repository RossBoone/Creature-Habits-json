    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents.\n\n I lift up my eyes to the mountains--\n    where does my help come from?\n My help comes from the Lord,\n    the Maker of heaven and earth.\n\n He will not let your foot slip--\n    he who watches over you will not slumber;\n indeed, he who watches over Israel\n    will neither slumber nor sleep.\n\n The Lord watches over you--\n    the Lord is your shade at your right hand;\n the sun will not harm you by day,\n    nor the moon by night.\n\n The Lord will keep you from all harm--\n    he will watch over your life;\n the Lord will watch over your coming and going\n    both now and forevermore.",
    "Script 2": " \"Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted,\n    I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise,[a]\n    your foundations with lapis lazuli.\n I will make your battlements of rubies,\n    your gates of sparkling jewels,\n    and all your walls of precious stones.\n All your children will be taught by the Lord,\n    and great will be their peace.\n In righteousness you will be established:\nTyranny will be far from you;\n    you will have nothing to fear.\nTerror will be far removed;\n    it will not come near you.\n If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing;\n    whoever attacks you will surrender to you.\n\n \"See, it is I who created the blacksmith\n    who fans the coals into flame\n    and forges a weapon fit for its work.\nAnd it is I who have created the destroyer to wreak havoc;\n     no weapon forged against you will prevail,\n    and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.\nThis is the heritage of the servants of the Lord,\n    and this is their vindication from me,\"\ndeclares the Lord.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.  For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship--and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.\n\n \"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.  And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.  From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.  God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.  'For in him we live and move and have our being.'[a] As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'[b]\n\n \"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by human design and skill.  In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.  For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\"\n\n When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.\"  At that, Paul left the Council.  Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.  For who can eat, or who can [a]have enjoyment, [b]more than I?  For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.\n\n \n",
