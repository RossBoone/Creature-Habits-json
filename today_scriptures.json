According to gittith.[b] Of Asaph.\n\n Sing for joy to God our strength;\n    shout aloud to the God of Jacob!\n\n I am the Lord your God,\n    who brought you up out of Egypt.\nOpen wide your mouth and I will fill it.\n\n \"But my people would not listen to me;\n    Israel would not submit to me.\n So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts\n    to follow their own devices.\n\n \"If my people would only listen to me,\n    if Israel would only follow my ways,\n how quickly I would subdue their enemies\n    and turn my hand against their foes!\n Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him,\n    and their punishment would last forever.\n But you would be fed with the finest of wheat;\n    with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.\"\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob,\n    all you clans of Israel.\n\n This is what the Lord says:\n\n\"What fault did your ancestors find in me,\n    that they strayed so far from me?\nThey followed worthless idols\n    and became worthless themselves.\n They did not ask, 'Where is the Lord,\n    who brought us up out of Egypt\nand led us through the barren wilderness,\n    through a land of deserts and ravines,\na land of drought and utter darkness,\n    a land where no one travels and no one lives?'\n I brought you into a fertile land\n    to eat its fruit and rich produce.\nBut you came and defiled my land\n    and made my inheritance detestable.\n The priests did not ask,\n    'Where is the Lord?'\nThose who deal with the law did not know me;\n    the leaders rebelled against me.\nThe prophets prophesied by Baal,\n    following worthless idols.\n\n \"Therefore I bring charges against you again,\"\ndeclares the Lord.\n    \"And I will bring charges against your children's children.\n Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look,\n    send to Kedar[a] and observe closely;\n    see if there has ever been anything like this:\n Has a nation ever changed its gods?\n    (Yet they are not gods at all.)\nBut my people have exchanged their glorious God\n    for worthless idols.\n Be appalled at this, you heavens,\n    and shudder with great horror,\"\ndeclares the Lord.\n \"My people have committed two sins:\nThey have forsaken me,\n    the spring of living water,\nand have dug their own cisterns,\n    broken cisterns that cannot hold water.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Concluding Exhortations\n\n Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.  Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.  Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.\n\n Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.  Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,\n\n\"Never will I leave you;\n    never will I forsake you.\"[a]\n\n So we say with confidence,\n\n\"The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\n    What can mere mortals do to me?\"[b]\n\n Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.\n\n Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise--the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.  And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "\nJesus at a Pharisee's House\n\n One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.\n\n When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:  \"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.  If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, 'Give this person your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.  But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.  For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"\n\n Then Jesus said to his host, \"When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.  But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,  and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\"",
