    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for [a]removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will [b]consider, though they are a rebellious house.  And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for [c]removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.  In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.\n\n And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.\n\n And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This [d]burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel [e]among whom they are.  Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.  And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.  My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.  And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.  And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.\n\n \n",

    "Script 2": "Isaiah :-\n\n Shout for joy, you heavens;\n    rejoice, you earth;\n    burst into song, you mountains!\nFor the Lord comforts his people\n    and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.\n\n But Zion said, \"The Lord has forsaken me,\n    the Lord has forgotten me.\"\n\n \"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast\n    and have no compassion on the child she has borne?\nThough she may forget,\n    I will not forget you!\n See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;\n    your walls are ever before me.\n Your children hasten back,\n    and those who laid you waste depart from you.\n Lift up your eyes and look around;\n    all your children gather and come to you.\nAs surely as I live,\" declares the Lord,\n    \"you will wear them all as ornaments;\n    you will put them on, like a bride.\n\n \"Though you were ruined and made desolate\n    and your land laid waste,\nnow you will be too small for your people,\n    and those who devoured you will be far away.\n The children born during your bereavement\n    will yet say in your hearing,\n'This place is too small for us;\n    give us more space to live in.'\n Then you will say in your heart,\n    'Who bore me these?\nI was bereaved and barren;\n    I was exiled and rejected.\n    Who brought these up?\nI was left all alone,\n    but these--where have they come from?'\"\n\n This is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n\n\"See, I will beckon to the nations,\n    I will lift up my banner to the peoples;\nthey will bring your sons in their arms\n    and carry your daughters on their hips.\n Kings will be your foster fathers,\n    and their queens your nursing mothers.\nThey will bow down before you with their faces to the ground;\n    they will lick the dust at your feet.\nThen you will know that I am the Lord;\n    those who hope in me will not be disappointed.\"",
    "Script 3": "Matthew :-\n\nThe Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven\n\n At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \"Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\"\n\n He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them.  And he said: \"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.\n\nCausing to Stumble\n\n \"If anyone causes one of these little ones--those who believe in me--to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.  Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!  If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.  And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.\n\nThe Parable of the Wandering Sheep\n\n \"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. [] [a]\n\n \"What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?  And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.  In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Ezekiel :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for [a]removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will [b]consider, though they are a rebellious house.  And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for [c]removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.  In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.\n\n And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.\n\n And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This [d]burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel [e]among whom they are.  Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.  And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.  My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.  And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.  And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.\n\n \n",
