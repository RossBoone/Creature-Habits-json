    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents. Of David.\n\n If the Lord had not been on our side--\n    let Israel say--\n if the Lord had not been on our side\n    when people attacked us,\n they would have swallowed us alive\n    when their anger flared against us;\n the flood would have engulfed us,\n    the torrent would have swept over us,\n the raging waters\n    would have swept us away.\n\n Praise be to the Lord,\n    who has not let us be torn by their teeth.\n We have escaped like a bird\n    from the fowler's snare;\nthe snare has been broken,\n    and we have escaped.\n Our help is in the name of the Lord,\n    the Maker of heaven and earth.",
    "Script 2": " But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.  Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.  The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,  and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.  The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.\n\n After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark  and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.  Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.  But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.  He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.  When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.  He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.\n\n By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.\n\n Then God said to Noah,  \"Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.  Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you--the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground--so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.\"\n\n So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.  All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds--everything that moves on land--came out of the ark, one kind after another.",
    "Script 3": "Dead to Sin, Alive in Christ\n\n What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?  By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?  Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?  We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.\n\n For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.  For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with,[a] that we should no longer be slaves to sin--  because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.\n\n Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.  For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.  The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.\n\n In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.  An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I [a]record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.  And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.  Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.\n\n \n",
