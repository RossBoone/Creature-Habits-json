    "Script 2": "Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses\n\n Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.  \"Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?\" they asked. \"Hasn't he also spoken through us?\" And the Lord heard this.\n\n (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)\n\n At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, \"Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.\" So the three of them went out.  Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward,  he said, \"Listen to my words:\n\n\"When there is a prophet among you,\n    I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions,\n    I speak to them in dreams.\n But this is not true of my servant Moses;\n    he is faithful in all my house.\n With him I speak face to face,\n    clearly and not in riddles;\n    he sees the form of the Lord.\nWhy then were you not afraid\n    to speak against my servant Moses?\"\n\n The anger of the Lord burned against them, and he left them.\n\n When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam's skin was leprous[a]--it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease,  and he said to Moses, \"Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.  Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away.\"\n\n So Moses cried out to the Lord, \"Please, God, heal her!\"\n\n The Lord replied to Moses, \"If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.\"  So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy\n\n While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.[a] When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\"\n\n Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" And immediately the leprosy left him.\n\n Then Jesus ordered him, \"Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\"\n\n Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.  But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;\nAnd let the earth hear the words of my mouth.\n My doctrine shall drop as the rain;\nMy speech shall distil as the dew,\nAs the small rain upon the tender grass,\nAnd as the showers upon the herb.\n For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah:\nAscribe ye greatness unto our God.\n The Rock, his work is perfect;\nFor all his ways are justice:\nA God of faithfulness and without iniquity,\nJust and right is he.\n They have [a]dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, [b]it is their blemish;\nThey are a perverse and crooked generation.\n Do ye thus requite Jehovah,\nO foolish people and unwise?\nIs not he thy father that hath [c]bought thee?\nHe hath made thee, and established thee.\n Remember the days of old,\nConsider the years of many generations:\nAsk thy father, and he will show thee;\nThine elders, and they will tell thee.\n When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,\nWhen he separated the children of men,\nHe set the bounds of the peoples\nAccording to the number of the children of Israel.\n For Jehovah's portion is his people;\nJacob is the lot of his inheritance.\n He found him in a desert land,\nAnd in the waste howling wilderness;\nHe compassed him about, he cared for him,\nHe kept him as the apple of his eye.\n As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,\nThat fluttereth over her young,\n[d]He spread abroad his wings, he took them,\nHe bare them on his pinions.\n Jehovah alone did lead him,\nAnd there was no foreign god with him.\n He made him ride on the high places of the earth,\nAnd he did eat the increase of the field;\nAnd he made him to suck honey out of the rock,\nAnd oil out of the flinty rock;\n Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,\nWith fat of lambs,\nAnd rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,\nWith the [e]finest of the wheat;\nAnd of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.\n\n \n",
