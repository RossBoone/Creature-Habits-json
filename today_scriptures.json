    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents. Of Solomon.\n\n Unless the Lord builds the house,\n    the builders labor in vain.\nUnless the Lord watches over the city,\n    the guards stand watch in vain.\n In vain you rise early\n    and stay up late,\ntoiling for food to eat--\n    for he grants sleep to[a] those he loves.\n\n Children are a heritage from the Lord,\n    offspring a reward from him.\n Like arrows in the hands of a warrior\n    are children born in one's youth.\n Blessed is the man\n    whose quiver is full of them.\nThey will not be put to shame\n    when they contend with their opponents in court.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Remember your Creator\n    in the days of your youth,\nbefore the days of trouble come\n    and the years approach when you will say,\n    \"I find no pleasure in them\"--\n before the sun and the light\n    and the moon and the stars grow dark,\n    and the clouds return after the rain;\n when the keepers of the house tremble,\n    and the strong men stoop,\nwhen the grinders cease because they are few,\n    and those looking through the windows grow dim;\n when the doors to the street are closed\n    and the sound of grinding fades;\nwhen people rise up at the sound of birds,\n    but all their songs grow faint;\n when people are afraid of heights\n    and of dangers in the streets;\nwhen the almond tree blossoms\n    and the grasshopper drags itself along\n    and desire no longer is stirred.\nThen people go to their eternal home\n    and mourners go about the streets.\n\n Remember him--before the silver cord is severed,\n    and the golden bowl is broken;\nbefore the pitcher is shattered at the spring,\n    and the wheel broken at the well,\n and the dust returns to the ground it came from,\n    and the spirit returns to God who gave it.\n\n \"Meaningless! Meaningless!\" says the Teacher.[a]\n    \"Everything is meaningless!\"\n\n Now all has been heard;\n    here is the conclusion of the matter:\nFear God and keep his commandments,\n    for this is the duty of all mankind.\n For God will bring every deed into judgment,\n    including every hidden thing,\n    whether it is good or evil.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Do Not Worry\n\n Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.  For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.  Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!  Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life[a]?  Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?\n\n \"Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.  If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you--you of little faith!  And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.  For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.  But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.\n\n",
