    "Script 2": " Laban answered Jacob, \"The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?  Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.\"\n\n So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.  He said to his relatives, \"Gather some stones.\" So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.  Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.[a]\n\n Laban said, \"This heap is a witness between you and me today.\" That is why it was called Galeed.  It was also called Mizpah,[b] because he said, \"May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.  If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.\"\n\n Laban also said to Jacob, \"Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.  This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.  May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\"\n\nSo Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.  He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.\n\n Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.[c]\n\nJacob Prepares to Meet Esau\n\n: [d]Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  When Jacob saw them, he said, \"This is the camp of God!\" So he named that place Mahanaim.[e]\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Dealing With False Teachers\n\n Keep reminding God's people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.  Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.  Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.  Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,  who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.  Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: \"The Lord knows those who are his,\" and, \"Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.\"\n\n In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.  Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.\n\n Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.  And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.  Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,  and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.",
