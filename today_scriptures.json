For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews[a] on behalf of God's truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed  and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:\n\n\"Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;\n    I will sing the praises of your name.\"[b]\n\n Again, it says,\n\n\"Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.\"[c]\n\n And again,\n\n\"Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;\n    let all the peoples extol him.\"[d]\n\n And again, Isaiah says,\n\n\"The Root of Jesse will spring up,\n    one who will arise to rule over the nations;\n    in him the Gentiles will hope.\"[e]\n\n May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n",

His food was locusts and wild honey.  People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.  Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.\n\n But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?  Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.  And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.  The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n \"I baptize you with[b] water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire.  His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\"\n\n",
