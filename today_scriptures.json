    "Script 1": "\n Praise the Lord.[b]\n\nBlessed are those who fear the Lord,\n    who find great delight in his commands.\n\n Their children will be mighty in the land;\n    the generation of the upright will be blessed.\n Wealth and riches are in their houses,\n    and their righteousness endures forever.\n Even in darkness light dawns for the upright,\n    for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.\n Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely,\n    who conduct their affairs with justice.\n\n Surely the righteous will never be shaken;\n    they will be remembered forever.\n They will have no fear of bad news;\n    their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.\n Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear;\n    in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.\n They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor,\n    their righteousness endures forever;\n    their horn[c] will be lifted high in honor.\n\n The wicked will see and be vexed,\n    they will gnash their teeth and waste away;\n    the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " The lips of fools bring them strife,\n    and their mouths invite a beating.\n\n The mouths of fools are their undoing,\n    and their lips are a snare to their very lives.\n\n The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;\n    they go down to the inmost parts.\n\n One who is slack in his work\n    is brother to one who destroys.\n\n The name of the Lord is a fortified tower;\n    the righteous run to it and are safe.\n\n The wealth of the rich is their fortified city;\n    they imagine it a wall too high to scale.\n\n Before a downfall the heart is haughty,\n    but humility comes before honor.",
    "Script 3": " The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.  Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.  Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.  Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.  If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.  It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.  How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.",
