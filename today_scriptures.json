    "Script 3": "John the Baptist Prepares the Way\n\n In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--  during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.  He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:\n\n\"A voice of one calling in the wilderness,\n'Prepare the way for the Lord,\n    make straight paths for him.\n Every valley shall be filled in,\n    every mountain and hill made low.\nThe crooked roads shall become straight,\n    the rough ways smooth.\n And all people will see God's salvation.'\"[a]\n\n John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?  Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.  The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n \"What should we do then?\" the crowd asked.\n\n John answered, \"Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.\"\n\n Even tax collectors came to be baptized. \"Teacher,\" they asked, \"what should we do?\"\n\n \"Don't collect any more than you are required to,\" he told them.\n\n Then some soldiers asked him, \"And what should we do?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay.\"\n\n The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.  John answered them all, \"I baptize you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire.  His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\"  And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:  and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.  And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:  the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,  and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,  and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,  and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,  and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.\n\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah; whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\n\n And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.",

    "Script 4": "Exodus \nAmerican Standard Version\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:  and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.  And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:  the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,  and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,  and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,  and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,  and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.\n\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah; whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\n\n And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.",
