    "Script 2": " \"Go in peace,\" Elisha said.\n\nAfter Naaman had traveled some distance,  Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \"My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\"\n\n So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked.\n\n \"Everything is all right,\" Gehazi answered. \"My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent[a] of silver and two sets of clothing.'\"\n\n \"By all means, take two talents,\" said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.  When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.\n\n When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, \"Where have you been, Gehazi?\"\n\n\"Your servant didn't go anywhere,\" Gehazi answered.\n\n But Elisha said to him, \"Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes--or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves?  Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.\" Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and his skin was leprous--it had become as white as snow.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "The Armor of God\n\n Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.  Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.  Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.  Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,  and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.  In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n\n And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.  Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,  for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.  And he said,\n\nJehovah came from Sinai,\nAnd rose from Seir unto them;\nHe shined forth from mount Paran,\nAnd he came from the ten thousands of [a]holy ones:\nAt his right hand [b]was a fiery law for them.\n Yea, he loveth the [c]people;\nAll [d]his saints are in thy hand:\nAnd they sat down at thy feet;\nEvery one [e]shall receive of thy words.\n Moses commanded us a law,\nAn inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.\n And [f]he was king in Jeshurun,\nWhen the heads of the people were gathered,\nAll the tribes of Israel together.\n Let Reuben live, and not die;\n[g]Nor let his men be few.\n\n And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said,\n\nHear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah,\nAnd bring him in unto his people.\n[h]With his hands he contended [i]for himself;\nAnd thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.\n\n And of Levi he said,\n\nThy Thummim and thy Urim are with [j]thy godly one,\nWhom thou didst prove at Massah,\nWith whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;\n Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;\nNeither did he acknowledge his brethren,\nNor knew he his own children:\nFor they have observed thy word,\nAnd keep thy covenant.\n They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances,\nAnd Israel thy law:\nThey shall put incense [k]before thee,\nAnd whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.\n Bless, Jehovah, his substance,\nAnd accept the work of his hands:\nSmite through the loins of them that rise up against him,\nAnd of them that hate him, that they rise not again.\n\n Of Benjamin he said,\n\nThe beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him;\nHe covereth him all the day long,\nAnd he dwelleth between his shoulders.\n\n And of Joseph he said,\n\nBlessed of Jehovah be his land,\nFor the precious things of heaven, for the dew,\nAnd for the deep that coucheth beneath,\n And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,\nAnd for the precious things of the growth of the [l]moons,\n And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,\nAnd for the precious things of the everlasting hills,\n And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,\nAnd the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.\nLet the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,\nAnd upon the crown of the head of him [m]that was separate from his brethren.\n [n]The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;\nAnd his horns are the horns of the wild-ox:\nWith them he shall [o]push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth:\nAnd they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,\nAnd they are the thousands of Manasseh.\n\n And of Zebulun he said,\n\nRejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;\nAnd, Issachar, in thy tents.\n They shall call the peoples unto the mountain;\nThere shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness:\nFor they shall suck the abundance of the seas,\nAnd the hidden treasures of the sand.\n\n And of Gad he said,\n\nBlessed be he that enlargeth Gad:\nHe dwelleth as a lioness,\nAnd teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.\n And he [p]provided the first part for himself,\nFor there was [q]the lawgiver's portion reserved;\nAnd he came [r]with the heads of the people;\nHe executed the righteousness of Jehovah,\nAnd his ordinances with Israel.\n\n And of Dan he said,\n\nDan is a lion's whelp,\nThat leapeth forth from Bashan.\n\n And of Naphtali he said,\n\nO Naphtali, satisfied with favor,\nAnd full with the blessing of Jehovah,\nPossess thou the [s]west and the south.\n\n And of Asher he said,\n\nBlessed be Asher [t]with children;\nLet him be acceptable unto his brethren,\nAnd let him dip his foot in oil.\n Thy [u]bars shall be iron and brass;\nAnd as thy days, so shall thy [v]strength be.\n There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,\nWho rideth upon the heavens for thy help,\nAnd in his excellency on the skies.\n The eternal God is thy dwelling-place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms.\nAnd he thrust out the enemy from before thee,\nAnd said, Destroy.\n And Israel dwelleth in safety,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone,\nIn a land of grain and new wine;\nYea, his heavens drop down dew.\n Happy art thou, O Israel:\nWho is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah,\nThe shield of thy help,\nAnd the sword of thy excellency!\nAnd thine enemies shall [w]submit themselves unto thee;\nAnd thou shalt tread upon their high places.\n\n \n",

Of David.\n\n Hear my cry, O God;\n    listen to my prayer.\n\n From the ends of the earth I call to you,\n    I call as my heart grows faint;\n    lead me to the rock that is higher than I.\n For you have been my refuge,\n    a strong tower against the foe.\n\n I long to dwell in your tent forever\n    and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.[b]\n For you, God, have heard my vows;\n    you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.\n\n Increase the days of the king's life,\n    his years for many generations.\n May he be enthroned in God's presence forever;\n    appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.\n\n Then I will ever sing in praise of your name\n    and fulfill my vows day after day.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Kings :-\n\n \"Go in peace,\" Elisha said.\n\nAfter Naaman had traveled some distance,  Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \"My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\"\n\n So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked.\n\n \"Everything is all right,\" Gehazi answered. \"My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent[a] of silver and two sets of clothing.'\"\n\n \"By all means, take two talents,\" said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.  When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.\n\n When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, \"Where have you been, Gehazi?\"\n\n\"Your servant didn't go anywhere,\" Gehazi answered.\n\n But Elisha said to him, \"Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes--or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves?  Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.\" Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and his skin was leprous--it had become as white as snow.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Ephesians :-\n\nThe Armor of God\n\n Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.  Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.  Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.  Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,  and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.  In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n\n And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.  Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,  for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.\n\n",
