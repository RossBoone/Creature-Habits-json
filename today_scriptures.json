And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.  Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.\n\n And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.  Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.\n\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land?  Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.  And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.  Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.\n\n And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.  And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.  And, lo, thou art unto them as [b]a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.  And when this cometh to pass (behold, it cometh), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.\n\n \n",

    "Script 2": "Isaiah :-\n\nIsrael Freed\n\n \"Listen to me, Jacob,\n    Israel, whom I have called:\nI am he;\n    I am the first and I am the last.\n My own hand laid the foundations of the earth,\n    and my right hand spread out the heavens;\nwhen I summon them,\n    they all stand up together.\n\n \"Come together, all of you, and listen:\n    Which of the idols has foretold these things?\nThe Lord's chosen ally\n    will carry out his purpose against Babylon;\n    his arm will be against the Babylonians.[a]\n I, even I, have spoken;\n    yes, I have called him.\nI will bring him,\n    and he will succeed in his mission.\n\n \"Come near me and listen to this:\n\n\"From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret;\n    at the time it happens, I am there.\"\n\nAnd now the Sovereign Lord has sent me,\n    endowed with his Spirit.\n\n This is what the Lord says--\n    your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:\n\"I am the Lord your God,\n    who teaches you what is best for you,\n    who directs you in the way you should go.\n If only you had paid attention to my commands,\n    your peace would have been like a river,\n    your well-being like the waves of the sea.\n Your descendants would have been like the sand,\n    your children like its numberless grains;\ntheir name would never be blotted out\n    nor destroyed from before me.\"\n\n Leave Babylon,\n    flee from the Babylonians!\nAnnounce this with shouts of joy\n    and proclaim it.\nSend it out to the ends of the earth;\n    say, \"The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.\"\n They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;\n    he made water flow for them from the rock;\nhe split the rock\n    and water gushed out.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Matthew :-\n\nJesus Questioned About Fasting\n\n Then John's disciples came and asked him, \"How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.\n\n \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.  Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\"",
    "Script 4": "Ezekiel :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die [a]therein.  And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.  Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.\n\n And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.  Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.\n\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land?  Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.  And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.  Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.\n\n And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.  And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.  And, lo, thou art unto them as [b]a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.  And when this cometh to pass (behold, it cometh), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.\n\n \n",
