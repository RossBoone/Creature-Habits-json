They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.  \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will send you out to fish for people.\"  At once they left their nets and followed him.\n\n Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets.
