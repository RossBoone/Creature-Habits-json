    "Script 1": "\n Blessed is the one\n    who does not walk in step with the wicked\nor stand in the way that sinners take\n    or sit in the company of mockers,\n but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,\n    and who meditates on his law day and night.\n That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,\n    which yields its fruit in season\nand whose leaf does not wither--\n    whatever they do prospers.\n\n Not so the wicked!\n    They are like chaff\n    that the wind blows away.\n Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\n    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.\n\n For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,\n    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.",
    "Script 2": " If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the Lord your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors.  He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land--your grain, new wine and olive oil--the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.  You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young.  The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you.  You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.\n\n You may say to yourselves, \"These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?\"  But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.  You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.  Moreover, the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.  Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.  The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.  But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.  He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them.  The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God.  Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.",
    "Script 3": "Final Greetings\n\n Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant[a] in the Lord.  I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our[b] circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.  He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.\n\n My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)  Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews[c] among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.  Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.  I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.  Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.  Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.\n\n After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.\n\n Tell Archippus: \"See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.\"\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of [a]Greece shall come.  But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that [b]holdeth with me [c]against these, but Michael your prince.\n\n \n",
