    "Script 2": " The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.  When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.\"\n\n \"Pardon me, my lord,\" Gideon replied, \"but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, 'Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.\"\n\n The Lord turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\"\n\n \"Pardon me, my lord,\" Gideon replied, \"but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\"\n\n The Lord answered, \"I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.\"\n\n Gideon replied, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.  Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.\"\n\nAnd the Lord said, \"I will wait until you return.\"\n\n Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah[a] of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.\n\n The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so.  Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the Lord disappeared.  When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, \"Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!\"\n\n But the Lord said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\"\n\n So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.  Therefore do not be partners with them.\n\n For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light  (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)  and find out what pleases the Lord.  Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.  But everything exposed by the light becomes visible--and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.  This is why it is said:\n\n\"Wake up, sleeper,\n    rise from the dead,\n    and Christ will shine on you.\"",
