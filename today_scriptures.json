    "Script 1": "\n Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob,\n    whose hope is in the Lord their God.\n\n He is the Maker of heaven and earth,\n    the sea, and everything in them--\n    he remains faithful forever.\n He upholds the cause of the oppressed\n    and gives food to the hungry.\nThe Lord sets prisoners free,\n     the Lord gives sight to the blind,\nthe Lord lifts up those who are bowed down,\n    the Lord loves the righteous.\n The Lord watches over the foreigner\n    and sustains the fatherless and the widow,\n    but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.\n\n The Lord reigns forever,\n    your God, O Zion, for all generations.\n\nPraise the Lord.",
    "Script 2": "Naomi Gains a Son\n\n So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.  The women said to Naomi: \"Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!  He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.\"\n\n Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him.  The women living there said, \"Naomi has a son!\" And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.",
    "Script 3": " Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives  as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.[a] That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.  But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.\n\n So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.  Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.  He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.\n\n Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position.  But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.  This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered: half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.  Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.  And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.\n\n And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.  And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:  when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.  So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.",
