    "Script 2": "Azariah King of Judah\n\n In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah[a] son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.  He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem.  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.  The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.\n\n The Lord afflicted the king with leprosy[b] until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house.[c] Jotham the king's son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.\n\n As for the other events of Azariah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?  Azariah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in the City of David. And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \"Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.  Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.  As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'  Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,[a] drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.\n\n \"Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts--  no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.  Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.  As you enter the home, give it your greeting.  If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.  If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.  Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and [a]that which is wanting cannot be numbered.  I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom [b]above all that were before me [c]in Jerusalem; yea, my heart [d]hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.  And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.  For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.\n\n \n",
