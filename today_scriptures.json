    "Script 3": " And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.[a]  For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.  I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.  My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,  so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power.\n\nGod's Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit\n\n We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.  No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.  None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  However, as it is written:\n\n\"What no eye has seen,\n    what no ear has heard,\nand what no human mind has conceived\"[b]--\n    the things God has prepared for those who love him--\n\n these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.\n\nThe Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.  For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.  What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.  This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c]  The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.  The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,  for,\n\n\"Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so as to instruct him?\"[d]\n\nBut we have the mind of Christ.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "\n: \"You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.\n\n: \"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.\n\n: No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.\n\n: In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.\n\n: \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.\n\n: For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.\n\n: Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n: For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\"",

    "Script 2": "Isaiah :-\n\nTrue Fasting\n\n \"Shout it aloud, do not hold back.\n    Raise your voice like a trumpet.\nDeclare to my people their rebellion\n    and to the descendants of Jacob their sins.\n For day after day they seek me out;\n    they seem eager to know my ways,\nas if they were a nation that does what is right\n    and has not forsaken the commands of its God.\nThey ask me for just decisions\n    and seem eager for God to come near them.\n 'Why have we fasted,' they say,\n    'and you have not seen it?\nWhy have we humbled ourselves,\n    and you have not noticed?'\n\n\"Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please\n    and exploit all your workers.\n Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife,\n    and in striking each other with wicked fists.\nYou cannot fast as you do today\n    and expect your voice to be heard on high.\n Is this the kind of fast I have chosen,\n    only a day for people to humble themselves?\nIs it only for bowing one's head like a reed\n    and for lying in sackcloth and ashes?\nIs that what you call a fast,\n    a day acceptable to the Lord?\n\n \"Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:\nto loose the chains of injustice\n    and untie the cords of the yoke,\nto set the oppressed free\n    and break every yoke?\n Is it not to share your food with the hungry\n    and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter--\nwhen you see the naked, to clothe them,\n    and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?\n Then your light will break forth like the dawn,\n    and your healing will quickly appear;\nthen your righteousness[a] will go before you,\n    and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.\n Then you will call, and the Lord will answer;\n    you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.\n\n\"If you do away with the yoke of oppression,\n    with the pointing finger and malicious talk,\n and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry\n    and satisfy the needs of the oppressed,\nthen your light will rise in the darkness,\n    and your night will become like the noonday.\n The Lord will guide you always;\n    he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land\n    and will strengthen your frame.\nYou will be like a well-watered garden,\n    like a spring whose waters never fail.\n Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins\n    and will raise up the age-old foundations;\nyou will be called Repairer of Broken Walls,\n    Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Corinthians :\n\n And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.[a]  For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.  I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.  My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,  so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power.\n\nGod's Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit\n\n We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.  No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.  None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  However, as it is written:\n\n\"What no eye has seen,\n    what no ear has heard,\nand what no human mind has conceived\"[b]--\n    the things God has prepared for those who love him--\n\n these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.\n\nThe Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.  For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.  What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.  This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c]  The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.  The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,  for,\n\n\"Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so as to instruct him?\"[d]\n\nBut we have the mind of Christ.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Matthew :-\n\n: \"You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.\n\n: \"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.\n\n: No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.\n\n: In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.\n\n: \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.\n\n: For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.\n\n: Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n: For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\"",
