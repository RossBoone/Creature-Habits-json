    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents.\n\n I lift up my eyes to you,\n    to you who sit enthroned in heaven.\n As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master,\n    as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress,\nso our eyes look to the Lord our God,\n    till he shows us his mercy.\n\n Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us,\n    for we have endured no end of contempt.\n We have endured no end\n    of ridicule from the arrogant,\n    of contempt from the proud.",
    "Script 2": "Zophar\n\n Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:\n\n \"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer\n    because I am greatly disturbed.\n I hear a rebuke that dishonors me,\n    and my understanding inspires me to reply.\n\n \"Surely you know how it has been from of old,\n    ever since mankind[a] was placed on the earth,\n that the mirth of the wicked is brief,\n    the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.\n Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens\n    and his head touches the clouds,\n he will perish forever, like his own dung;\n    those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'\n Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found,\n    banished like a vision of the night.\n The eye that saw him will not see him again;\n    his place will look on him no more.\n His children must make amends to the poor;\n    his own hands must give back his wealth.\n The youthful vigor that fills his bones\n    will lie with him in the dust.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\"[a]  We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.\n\n We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.  Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things.  For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.  And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.",
