    "Script 2": "Hezekiah King of Judah\n\n In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.  He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah[a] daughter of Zechariah.  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David had done.  He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.[b])\n\n Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him.  He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following him; he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses.  And the Lord was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.  From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory.\n\n Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, \"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!  This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.  Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, 'The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'\n\n \"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,  until I come and take you to a land like your own--a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death!\n\n\"Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, 'The Lord will deliver us.'  Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?  Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?  Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?\"\n\n But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, \"Do not answer him.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "To the Church in Smyrna\n\n \"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:\n\nThese are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.  I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.  Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown.\n\n Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man's life to pledge.\n\n If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him [a]as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.\n\n Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.  Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.\n\n \n",
