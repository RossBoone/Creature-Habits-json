And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

    "Script 1": "Psalm \n\nA psalm of Asaph.\n\n Surely God is good to Israel,\n    to those who are pure in heart.\n\n But as for me, my feet had almost slipped;\n    I had nearly lost my foothold.\n For I envied the arrogant\n    when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\n\n They have no struggles;\n    their bodies are healthy and strong.[a]\n They are free from common human burdens;\n    they are not plagued by human ills.\n Therefore pride is their necklace;\n    they clothe themselves with violence.\n From their callous hearts comes iniquity[b];\n    their evil imaginations have no limits.\n They scoff, and speak with malice;\n    with arrogance they threaten oppression.\n Their mouths lay claim to heaven,\n    and their tongues take possession of the earth.\n Therefore their people turn to them\n    and drink up waters in abundance.[c]\n They say, \"How would God know?\n    Does the Most High know anything?\"\n\n This is what the wicked are like--\n    always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.\n\n Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure\n    and have washed my hands in innocence.\n All day long I have been afflicted,\n    and every morning brings new punishments.\n\n If I had spoken out like that,\n    I would have betrayed your children.\n When I tried to understand all this,\n    it troubled me deeply\n till I entered the sanctuary of God;\n    then I understood their final destiny.\n\n Surely you place them on slippery ground;\n    you cast them down to ruin.\n How suddenly are they destroyed,\n    completely swept away by terrors!\n They are like a dream when one awakes;\n    when you arise, Lord,\n    you will despise them as fantasies.\n\n When my heart was grieved\n    and my spirit embittered,\n I was senseless and ignorant;\n    I was a brute beast before you.\n\n Yet I am always with you;\n    you hold me by my right hand.\n You guide me with your counsel,\n    and afterward you will take me into glory.\n Whom have I in heaven but you?\n    And earth has nothing I desire besides you.\n My flesh and my heart may fail,\n    but God is the strength of my heart\n    and my portion forever.\n\n Those who are far from you will perish;\n    you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.\n But as for me, it is good to be near God.\n    I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge;\n    I will tell of all your deeds.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Job :-\n\n Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm:\n\n \"Brace yourself like a man;\n    I will question you,\n    and you shall answer me.\n\n \"Would you discredit my justice?\n    Would you condemn me to justify yourself?\n Do you have an arm like God's,\n    and can your voice thunder like his?\n Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor,\n    and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.\n Unleash the fury of your wrath,\n    look at all who are proud and bring them low,\n look at all who are proud and humble them,\n    crush the wicked where they stand.\n Bury them all in the dust together;\n    shroud their faces in the grave.\n Then I myself will admit to you\n    that your own right hand can save you.\n\nJob :-\n\n Then Job replied to the Lord:\n\n \"I know that you can do all things;\n    no purpose of yours can be thwarted.\n You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?'\n    Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,\n    things too wonderful for me to know.\n\n \"You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak;\n    I will question you,\n    and you shall answer me.'\n My ears had heard of you\n    but now my eyes have seen you.\n Therefore I despise myself\n    and repent in dust and ashes.\"",
    "Script 3": "Luke :-, -\n\n \"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.  But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.\"\n\n But he replied, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\"\n\nPeter Disowns Jesus\n\n Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.  And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.  A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \"This man was with him.\"\n\n But he denied it. \"Woman, I don't know him,\" he said.\n\n A little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.\"\n\n\"Man, I am not!\" Peter replied.\n\n About an hour later another asserted, \"Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\"\n\n Peter replied, \"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.  The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\"  And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
    "Script 4": "Deuteronomy :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;  of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;  thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:  but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.  And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.\n\n If thou shalt hear tell [a]concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,  Certain [b]base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;  then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,  thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, [c]destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.  And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof [d]every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a [e]heap for ever; it shall not be built again.  And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;  when thou shalt hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.\n\n \n",
