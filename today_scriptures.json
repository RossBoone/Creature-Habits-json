Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness[a] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.

    "Script 4": "\nThe Resurrection and Marriage\n\n Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.  \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.  Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.  The second  and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.  Finally, the woman died too.  Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\"\n\n Jesus replied, \"The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.  But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,  and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.  But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'[a]  He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.\"\n\n",

    "Script 1": "Psalm :-\n\nA prayer of David.\n\n Hear me, Lord, my plea is just;\n    listen to my cry.\nHear my prayer--\n    it does not rise from deceitful lips.\n Let my vindication come from you;\n    may your eyes see what is right.\n\n Though you probe my heart,\n    though you examine me at night and test me,\nyou will find that I have planned no evil;\n    my mouth has not transgressed.\n Though people tried to bribe me,\n    I have kept myself from the ways of the violent\n    through what your lips have commanded.\n My steps have held to your paths;\n    my feet have not stumbled.\n\n I call on you, my God, for you will answer me;\n    turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.\n Show me the wonders of your great love,\n    you who save by your right hand\n    those who take refuge in you from their foes.\n Keep me as the apple of your eye;\n    hide me in the shadow of your wings\n from the wicked who are out to destroy me,\n    from my mortal enemies who surround me. \n\nPsalm \n\nA psalm.\n\n Sing to the Lord a new song,\n    for he has done marvelous things;\nhis right hand and his holy arm\n    have worked salvation for him.\n The Lord has made his salvation known\n    and revealed his righteousness to the nations.\n He has remembered his love\n    and his faithfulness to Israel;\nall the ends of the earth have seen\n    the salvation of our God.\n Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth,\n    burst into jubilant song with music;\n make music to the Lord with the harp,\n    with the harp and the sound of singing,\n with trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn--\n    shout for joy before the Lord, the King.\n Let the sea resound, and everything in it,\n    the world, and all who live in it.\n Let the rivers clap their hands,\n    let the mountains sing together for joy;\n let them sing before the Lord,\n    for he comes to judge the earth.\nHe will judge the world in righteousness\n    and the peoples with equity.\n\nPsalm :[a]-; -\n\nA psalm of praise. Of David.\n\n I will exalt you, my God the King;\n    I will praise your name for ever and ever.\n Every day I will praise you\n    and extol your name for ever and ever.\n\n Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise;\n    his greatness no one can fathom.\n One generation commends your works to another;\n    they tell of your mighty acts.\n They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty--\n    and I will meditate on your wonderful works.[b]\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Job :-\n\n \"Oh, that my words were recorded,\n    that they were written on a scroll,\n that they were inscribed with an iron tool on[a] lead,\n    or engraved in rock forever!\n I know that my redeemer[b] lives,\n    and that in the end he will stand on the earth.[c]\n And after my skin has been destroyed,\n    yet[d] in[e] my flesh I will see God;\n I myself will see him\n    with my own eyes--I, and not another.\n    How my heart yearns within me!\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Thessalonians :-, -\n\nThe Man of Lawlessness\n\n Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,  not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us--whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter--asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.  Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness[a] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.  He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.\n\n Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Luke :-\n\nThe Resurrection and Marriage\n\n Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.  \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.  Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.  The second  and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.  Finally, the woman died too.  Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\"\n\n Jesus replied, \"The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.  But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,  and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.  But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'[a]  He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.\"\n\n",
