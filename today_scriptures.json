    "Script 2": "Saul and the Medium at Endor\n\n Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.\n\n The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa.  When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.  He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.  Saul then said to his attendants, \"Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.\"\n\n\"There is one in Endor,\" they said.\n\n So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. \"Consult a spirit for me,\" he said, \"and bring up for me the one I name.\"\n\n But the woman said to him, \"Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?\"\n\n Saul swore to her by the Lord, \"As surely as the Lord lives, you will not be punished for this.\"\n\n Then the woman asked, \"Whom shall I bring up for you?\"\n\n\"Bring up Samuel,\" he said.\n\n When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, \"Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!\"\n\n The king said to her, \"Don't be afraid. What do you see?\"\n\nThe woman said, \"I see a ghostly figure[a] coming up out of the earth.\"\n\n \"What does he look like?\" he asked.\n\n\"An old man wearing a robe is coming up,\" she said.\n\nThen Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.\n\n Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\"\n\n\"I am in great distress,\" Saul said. \"The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.\"\n\n Samuel said, \"Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy?  The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors--to David.  Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today.  The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "God's Wrath Against Sinful Humanity\n\n The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.  For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\n\n For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.\n\n Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.  They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.",
