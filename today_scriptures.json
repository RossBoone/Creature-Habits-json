    "Script 2": " Moses said to God, \"Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?\"\n\n God said to Moses, \"I am who I am.[a] This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'\"\n\n God also said to Moses, \"Say to the Israelites, 'The Lord,[b] the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.'\n\n\"This is my name forever,\n    the name you shall call me\n    from generation to generation.\n\n \"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.  And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--a land flowing with milk and honey.'\n\n \"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.'  But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.  So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.\n\n\n",
    "Script 3": "The Authority of Jesus Questioned\n\n One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.  \"Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,\" they said. \"Who gave you this authority?\"\n\n He replied, \"I will also ask you a question. Tell me:  John's baptism--was it from heaven, or of human origin?\"\n\n They discussed it among themselves and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'  But if we say, 'Of human origin,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.\"\n\n So they answered, \"We don't know where it was from.\"\n\n Jesus said, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\"",

And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.  And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.",
