    "Script 2": " The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah;\n    he will punish Jacob[a] according to his ways\n    and repay him according to his deeds.\n In the womb he grasped his brother's heel;\n    as a man he struggled with God.\n He struggled with the angel and overcame him;\n    he wept and begged for his favor.\nHe found him at Bethel\n    and talked with him there--\n the Lord God Almighty,\n    the Lord is his name!\n But you must return to your God;\n    maintain love and justice,\n    and wait for your God always.\n\n The merchant uses dishonest scales\n    and loves to defraud.\n Ephraim boasts,\n    \"I am very rich; I have become wealthy.\nWith all my wealth they will not find in me\n    any iniquity or sin.\"\n\n \"I have been the Lord your God\n    ever since you came out of Egypt;\nI will make you live in tents again,\n    as in the days of your appointed festivals.\n I spoke to the prophets,\n    gave them many visions\n    and told parables through them.\"\n\n Is Gilead wicked?\n    Its people are worthless!\nDo they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?\n    Their altars will be like piles of stones\n    on a plowed field.\n Jacob fled to the country of Aram[b];\n    Israel served to get a wife,\n    and to pay for her he tended sheep.\n The Lord used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt,\n    by a prophet he cared for him.\n But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger;\n    his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed\n    and will repay him for his contempt.\n\n",

If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\"\n\n \"Which ones?\" he inquired.\n\nJesus replied, \"'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,  honor your father and mother,'[a] and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'[b]\"\n\n \"All these I have kept,\" the young man said. \"What do I still lack?\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee.  Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.\n\n Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a sojourner in his land.  The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah.\n\n When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing.  If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:  but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.  Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:  and thou shalt have a [b]paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:  for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see [c]an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.\n\n Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee:  he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him.\n\n There shall be no [d]prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a [e]sodomite of the sons of Israel.  Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.\n\n Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest.  Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.\n\n \n",

    "Script 2": "Hosea :-\n\n The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah;\n    he will punish Jacob[a] according to his ways\n    and repay him according to his deeds.\n In the womb he grasped his brother's heel;\n    as a man he struggled with God.\n He struggled with the angel and overcame him;\n    he wept and begged for his favor.\nHe found him at Bethel\n    and talked with him there--\n the Lord God Almighty,\n    the Lord is his name!\n But you must return to your God;\n    maintain love and justice,\n    and wait for your God always.\n\n The merchant uses dishonest scales\n    and loves to defraud.\n Ephraim boasts,\n    \"I am very rich; I have become wealthy.\nWith all my wealth they will not find in me\n    any iniquity or sin.\"\n\n \"I have been the Lord your God\n    ever since you came out of Egypt;\nI will make you live in tents again,\n    as in the days of your appointed festivals.\n I spoke to the prophets,\n    gave them many visions\n    and told parables through them.\"\n\n Is Gilead wicked?\n    Its people are worthless!\nDo they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?\n    Their altars will be like piles of stones\n    on a plowed field.\n Jacob fled to the country of Aram[b];\n    Israel served to get a wife,\n    and to pay for her he tended sheep.\n The Lord used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt,\n    by a prophet he cared for him.\n But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger;\n    his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed\n    and will repay him for his contempt.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Matthew :-\n\nThe Rich and the Kingdom of God\n\n Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, \"Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\"\n\n \"Why do you ask me about what is good?\" Jesus replied. \"There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\"\n\n \"Which ones?\" he inquired.\n\nJesus replied, \"'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,  honor your father and mother,'[a] and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'[b]\"\n\n \"All these I have kept,\" the young man said. \"What do I still lack?\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\"\n\n When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Deuteronomy :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah.\n\n A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah.\n\n An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:  because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of [a]Mesopotamia, to curse thee.  Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee.  Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.\n\n Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a sojourner in his land.  The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah.\n\n When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing.  If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:  but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.  Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:  and thou shalt have a [b]paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:  for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see [c]an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.\n\n Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee:  he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him.\n\n There shall be no [d]prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a [e]sodomite of the sons of Israel.  Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.\n\n Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest.  Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.\n\n \n",
