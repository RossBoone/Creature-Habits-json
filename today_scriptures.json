    "Script 1": "\nOf David.\n\n Do not fret because of those who are evil\n    or be envious of those who do wrong;\n for like the grass they will soon wither,\n    like green plants they will soon die away.\n\n Trust in the Lord and do good;\n    dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.\n Take delight in the Lord,\n    and he will give you the desires of your heart.\n\n Commit your way to the Lord;\n    trust in him and he will do this:\n He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,\n    your vindication like the noonday sun.\n\n Be still before the Lord\n    and wait patiently for him;\ndo not fret when people succeed in their ways,\n    when they carry out their wicked schemes.\n\n Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;\n    do not fret--it leads only to evil.\n For those who are evil will be destroyed,\n    but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "The Sign of Immanuel\n\n When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.\n\n Now the house of David was told, \"Aram has allied itself with[a] Ephraim\"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.\n\n Then the Lord said to Isaiah, \"Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub,[b] to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field.  Say to him, 'Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood--because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.  Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,  \"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.\"  Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n\n\"'It will not take place,\n    it will not happen,\n for the head of Aram is Damascus,\n    and the head of Damascus is only Rezin.\nWithin sixty-five years\n    Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.\n The head of Ephraim is Samaria,\n    and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son.\nIf you do not stand firm in your faith,\n    you will not stand at all.'\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Two Blind Men Receive Sight\n\n As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.  Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!\"\n\n The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!\"\n\n Jesus stopped and called them. \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked.\n\n \"Lord,\" they answered, \"we want our sight.\"\n\n Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets;  then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity.\n\n Thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small.  Thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures, a great and a small.  A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.  For all that do such things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.\n\n Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt;  how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.  Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget.",
