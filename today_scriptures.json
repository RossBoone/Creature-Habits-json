    "Script 2": " On the altar of the Lord that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord,  according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons and the three annual festivals--the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles.  In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered.  They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries.",
    "Script 3": "In Thessalonica\n\n When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.  As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,  explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. \"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,\" he said.  Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.\n\n But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.[a]  But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,  and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\"  When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.  Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, [a]his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.  And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.  He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.  But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.\n\n \n",
