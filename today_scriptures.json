    "Script 1": "\n Praise the Lord.[a]\n\nPraise the Lord from the heavens;\n    praise him in the heights above.\n Praise him, all his angels;\n    praise him, all his heavenly hosts.\n Praise him, sun and moon;\n    praise him, all you shining stars.\n Praise him, you highest heavens\n    and you waters above the skies.\n\n Let them praise the name of the Lord,\n    for at his command they were created,\n and he established them for ever and ever--\n    he issued a decree that will never pass away.\n\n Praise the Lord from the earth,\n    you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,\n lightning and hail, snow and clouds,\n    stormy winds that do his bidding,\n you mountains and all hills,\n    fruit trees and all cedars,\n wild animals and all cattle,\n    small creatures and flying birds,\n kings of the earth and all nations,\n    you princes and all rulers on earth,\n young men and women,\n    old men and children.\n\n Let them praise the name of the Lord,\n    for his name alone is exalted;\n    his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.\n And he has raised up for his people a horn,[b]\n    the praise of all his faithful servants,\n    of Israel, the people close to his heart.\n\nPraise the Lord.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Praise and Prayer\n\n I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord,\n    the deeds for which he is to be praised,\n    according to all the Lord has done for us--\nyes, the many good things\n    he has done for Israel,\n    according to his compassion and many kindnesses.\n He said, \"Surely they are my people,\n    children who will be true to me\";\n    and so he became their Savior.\n In all their distress he too was distressed,\n    and the angel of his presence saved them.[a]\nIn his love and mercy he redeemed them;\n    he lifted them up and carried them\n    all the days of old.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.  Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.[a]  He says,\n\n\"I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters;\n    in the assembly I will sing your praises.\"[b]\n\n And again,\n\n\"I will put my trust in him.\"[c]\n\nAnd again he says,\n\n\"Here am I, and the children God has given me.\"[d]\n\n Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.  For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.  For this reason he had to be made like them,[e] fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.  Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "\nThe Escape to Egypt\n\n When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. \"Get up,\" he said, \"take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.\"\n\n So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,  where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\"[a]\n\n When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.  Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n \"A voice is heard in Ramah,\n    weeping and great mourning,\nRachel weeping for her children\n    and refusing to be comforted,\n    because they are no more.\"[b]\n\nThe Return to Nazareth\n\n After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt  and said, \"Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead.\"\n\n So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.  But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,  and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.\n\n",
