    "Script 2": " A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.  His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings--he was a Calebite.\n\n While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.  So he sent ten young men and said to them, \"Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.  Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!\n\n \"'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.  Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'\"\n\n When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited.\n\n Nabal answered David's servants, \"Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.  Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?\"\n\n David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.  David said to his men, \"Each of you strap on your sword!\" So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.\n\n One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal's wife, \"David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.  Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.  Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them.  Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.\"\n\n Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs[a] of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.  Then she told her servants, \"Go on ahead; I'll follow you.\" But she did not tell her husband Nabal.\n\n As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.  David had just said, \"It's been useless--all my watching over this fellow's property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.  May God deal with David,[b] be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Lawsuits Among Believers\n\n If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people?  Or do you not know that the Lord's people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?  Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!  Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church?  I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?  But instead, one brother takes another to court--and this in front of unbelievers!\n\n The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?  Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters.  Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men[a]  nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\n\n",
