    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.\n\n Have mercy on me, O God,\n    according to your unfailing love;\naccording to your great compassion\n    blot out my transgressions.\n Wash away all my iniquity\n    and cleanse me from my sin.\n\n For I know my transgressions,\n    and my sin is always before me.\n Against you, you only, have I sinned\n    and done what is evil in your sight;\nso you are right in your verdict\n    and justified when you judge.\n Surely I was sinful at birth,\n    sinful from the time my mother conceived me.\n Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;\n    you taught me wisdom in that secret place.\n\n Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;\n    wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.\n Let me hear joy and gladness;\n    let the bones you have crushed rejoice.\n Hide your face from my sins\n    and blot out all my iniquity.\n\n Create in me a pure heart, O God,\n    and renew a steadfast spirit within me.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.  The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: \"Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though[a] every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.\n\n \"As long as the earth endures,\nseedtime and harvest,\ncold and heat,\nsummer and winter,\nday and night\nwill never cease.\"\n\nGod's Covenant With Noah\n\n: Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.  The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.  Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.\n\n \"But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.  And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.\n\n \"Whoever sheds human blood,\n    by humans shall their blood be shed;\nfor in the image of God\n    has God made mankind.\n\n As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": " \"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.  The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.\n\n \"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me--  just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep.  I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.  The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again.  No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.\"\n\n The Jews who heard these words were again divided.  Many of them said, \"He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?\"\n\n But others said, \"These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n (And the children of Israel journeyed from [a]Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.  From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.  At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
