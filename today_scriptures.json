    "Script 1": "\n Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,\n    the people he chose for his inheritance.\n From heaven the Lord looks down\n    and sees all mankind;\n from his dwelling place he watches\n    all who live on earth--\n he who forms the hearts of all,\n    who considers everything they do.\n\n No king is saved by the size of his army;\n    no warrior escapes by his great strength.\n A horse is a vain hope for deliverance;\n    despite all its great strength it cannot save.\n But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him,\n    on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,\n to deliver them from death\n    and keep them alive in famine.\n\n We wait in hope for the Lord;\n    he is our help and our shield.\n In him our hearts rejoice,\n    for we trust in his holy name.\n May your unfailing love be with us, Lord,\n    even as we put our hope in you.",
    "Script 2": " I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind:  God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.\n\n A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.  It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.  Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man--  even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?",
    "Script 3": "Stephen's Speech to the Sanhedrin\n\n Then the high priest asked Stephen, \"Are these charges true?\"\n\n To this he replied: \"Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran.  'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.'[a]\n\n \"So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.  He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.  God spoke to him in this way: 'For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated.  But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.'[b]  Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.  And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.  And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And those were the days of unleavened bread.  And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.  Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.  And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.  And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.  And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.  And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done [a]by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.  And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.  And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.  And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.  And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.  And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.  And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.  But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.  But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.  Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.  And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be [b]put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.\n\n \n",
