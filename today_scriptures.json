    "Script 2": "The Writing on the Wall\n\n King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.  While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father[a] had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.  So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.  As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.\n\n Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.  His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.\n\n The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers[b] and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, \"Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.\"\n\n Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.  So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.\n\n The queen,[c] hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. \"May the king live forever!\" she said. \"Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!  There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.  He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "To the Elders and the Flock\n\n To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed:  Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, watching over them--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;  not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.  And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.\n\n In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because,\n\n\"God opposes the proud\n    but shows favor to the humble.\"[a]\n\n Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.  Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.\n\n Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.  Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.\n\n And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.  To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n [a]Cast thy bread [b]upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.  [c]Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.  If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall [d]toward the south, or [e]toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.  As thou knowest not what is the way of the [f]wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.  Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.  [g]Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; [h]but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.  Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.  Therefore remove [i]sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.\n\n \n",
