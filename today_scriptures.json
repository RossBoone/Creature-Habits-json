    "Script 2": "The Lord Promises to Bless Jerusalem\n\n The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.\"\n\n This is what the Lord says: \"I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.  The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?\" declares the Lord Almighty.\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.  I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Now hear these words, 'Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.' This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty.  Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.  But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,\" declares the Lord Almighty.\n\n \"The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.  Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse[a] among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing.[b] Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,\" says the Lord Almighty,  \"so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.  These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;  do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,\" declares the Lord.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Jesus Heals Many\n\n When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.  He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.\n\n When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.  This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n\n\"He took up our infirmities\n    and bore our diseases.\"[a]\n\nJesus Restores Two Demon-Possessed Men\n\n When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,[b] two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.  \"What do you want with us, Son of God?\" they shouted. \"Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\"\n\n Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.  The demons begged Jesus, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\"\n\n He said to them, \"Go!\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.  Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.  Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it.  And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a [a]crown of gold to it round about.  And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one [b]side of it, and two rings on the other [c]side of it.  And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.  And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.  And he made a [d]mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.  And he made two cherubim of gold; of [e]beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;  one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof.  And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.\n\n And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.  And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.  And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about.  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.  Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.  And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.  And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.\n\n And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it.  And there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:  three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.  And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;  and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.  Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.  And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold.  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.\n\n And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it.  And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about.  And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it.  And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.  And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.\n\n \n",

Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.  Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.\n\nFootnotes\na. Matthew : Isaiah : (see Septuagint)\nb. Matthew : Some manuscripts Gergesenes; other manuscripts Gerasenes",
    "Script 4": "Exodus \nAmerican Standard Version\n And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it.  And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a [a]crown of gold to it round about.  And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one [b]side of it, and two rings on the other [c]side of it.  And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.  And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.  And he made a [d]mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.  And he made two cherubim of gold; of [e]beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;  one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof.  And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.\n\n And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.  And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.  And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about.  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.  Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.  And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.  And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.\n\n And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it.  And there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:  three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.  And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;  and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.  Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.  And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold.  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.\n\n And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it.  And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about.  And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it.  And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.  And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.\n\n \nFootnotes\nExodus : Or, rim.

    "Script 2": "Zechariah :-\n\nThe Lord Promises to Bless Jerusalem\n\n The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.\"\n\n This is what the Lord says: \"I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.  The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?\" declares the Lord Almighty.\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.  I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Now hear these words, 'Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.' This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty.  Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.  But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,\" declares the Lord Almighty.\n\n \"The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.  Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse[a] among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing.[b] Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.\"\n\n This is what the Lord Almighty says: \"Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,\" says the Lord Almighty,  \"so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.  These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;  do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,\" declares the Lord.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Matthew :-, -\n\nJesus Heals Many\n\n When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.  He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.\n\n When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.  This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n\n\"He took up our infirmities\n    and bore our diseases.\"[a]\n\nJesus Restores Two Demon-Possessed Men\n\n When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,[b] two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.  \"What do you want with us, Son of God?\" they shouted. \"Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\"\n\n Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.  The demons begged Jesus, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\"\n\n He said to them, \"Go!\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
