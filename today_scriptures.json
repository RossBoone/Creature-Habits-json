    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. To the tune of \"Do Not Destroy.\" Of David. A miktam.[b] When he had fled from Saul into the cave.\n\n Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me,\n    for in you I take refuge.\nI will take refuge in the shadow of your wings\n    until the disaster has passed.\n\n I cry out to God Most High,\n    to God, who vindicates me.\n He sends from heaven and saves me,\n    rebuking those who hotly pursue me--[c]\n    God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.\n\n I am in the midst of lions;\n    I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts--\nmen whose teeth are spears and arrows,\n    whose tongues are sharp swords.\n\n Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;\n    let your glory be over all the earth.\n\n They spread a net for my feet--\n    I was bowed down in distress.\nThey dug a pit in my path--\n    but they have fallen into it themselves.\n\n My heart, O God, is steadfast,\n    my heart is steadfast;\n    I will sing and make music.\n Awake, my soul!\n    Awake, harp and lyre!\n    I will awaken the dawn.\n\n I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;\n    I will sing of you among the peoples.\n For great is your love, reaching to the heavens;\n    your faithfulness reaches to the skies.\n\n Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;\n    let your glory be over all the earth.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak.  Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.  About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died.\n\n When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head.\"\n\nThen David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.  His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, \"David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.\"\n\n She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, \"I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord's servants.\"  Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David's messengers and became his wife.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives\n\n Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.  On reaching the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you will not fall into temptation.\"  He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,  \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\"  An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.  And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.[a]\n\n When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.  \"Why are you sleeping?\" he asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\"\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.  For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? [a]or what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?  Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.  [b]Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is known what [c]man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.  Seeing there are many [d]things that increase vanity, what is man the better?  For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, [e]all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?\n\n \n",
