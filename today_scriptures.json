    "Script 1": "\nOf David. A maskil.[a]\n\n Blessed is the one\n    whose transgressions are forgiven,\n    whose sins are covered.\n Blessed is the one\n    whose sin the Lord does not count against them\n    and in whose spirit is no deceit.\n\n When I kept silent,\n    my bones wasted away\n    through my groaning all day long.\n For day and night\n    your hand was heavy on me;\nmy strength was sapped\n    as in the heat of summer.[b]\n\n Then I acknowledged my sin to you\n    and did not cover up my iniquity.\nI said, \"I will confess\n    my transgressions to the Lord.\"\nAnd you forgave\n    the guilt of my sin.\n\n Therefore let all the faithful pray to you\n    while you may be found;\nsurely the rising of the mighty waters\n    will not reach them.\n You are my hiding place;\n    you will protect me from trouble\n    and surround me with songs of deliverance.\n\n I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;\n    I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.\n Do not be like the horse or the mule,\n    which have no understanding\nbut must be controlled by bit and bridle\n    or they will not come to you.\n Many are the woes of the wicked,\n    but the Lord's unfailing love\n    surrounds the one who trusts in him.\n\n Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;\n    sing, all you who are upright in heart!\n\n",
    "Script 2": "The Cup of God's Wrath\n\n This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: \"Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.  When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.\"\n\n So I took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:  Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse[a]--as they are today;  Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people,  and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod);  Edom, Moab and Ammon;  all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;  Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places[b];  all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness;  all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media;  and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other--all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak[c] will drink it too.\n\n \"Then tell them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.'  But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: You must drink it!  See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the Lord Almighty.'\n\n",
    "Script 3": " \"Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.  After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,  who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.[a]  But it was Solomon who built a house for him.\n\n \"However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:\n\n \"'Heaven is my throne,\n    and the earth is my footstool.\nWhat kind of house will you build for me?\nsays the Lord.\n    Or where will my resting place be?\n Has not my hand made all these things?'[b]\n\n \"You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute?
