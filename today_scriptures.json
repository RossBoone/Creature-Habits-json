    "Script 1": "\n Blessed is the one\n    who does not walk in step with the wicked\nor stand in the way that sinners take\n    or sit in the company of mockers,\n but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,\n    and who meditates on his law day and night.\n That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,\n    which yields its fruit in season\nand whose leaf does not wither--\n    whatever they do prospers.\n\n Not so the wicked!\n    They are like chaff\n    that the wind blows away.\n Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\n    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.\n\n For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,\n    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.",
    "Script 2": "Joseph and Potiphar's Wife\n\n Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.\n\n The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.  When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did,  Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.  From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.  So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph's care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.\n\nNow Joseph was well-built and handsome,  and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, \"Come to bed with me!\"\n\n But he refused. \"With me in charge,\" he told her, \"my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.  No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?\"  And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.\n\n One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.  She caught him by his cloak and said, \"Come to bed with me!\" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.\n\n When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,  she called her household servants. \"Look,\" she said to them, \"this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.  When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.\"\n\n She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.  Then she told him this story: \"That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.  But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.\"\n\n When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, \"This is how your slave treated me,\" he burned with anger.  Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined.\n\nBut while Joseph was there in the prison,  the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.  So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.  The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.",
    "Script 3": " But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.  For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.  Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.  Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.  So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,  because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.\n",
