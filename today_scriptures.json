    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.  I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside [a]many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.  Then will I [b]make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of [c]that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.  This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.  They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: [d]she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.\n\n Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;  whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.\n\n There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.\n\n There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.  [e]And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.  But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.\n\n There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who [f]in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.  There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; [g]in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.\n\n Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, [h]even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.  For I have put [i]his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n \n",

    "Script 1": "Psalm :-\n\n Sacrifice and offering you did not desire--\n    but my ears you have opened[a]--\n    burnt offerings and sin offerings[b] you did not require.\n Then I said, \"Here I am, I have come--\n    it is written about me in the scroll.[c]\n I desire to do your will, my God;\n    your law is within my heart.\"\n\n I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;\n    I do not seal my lips, Lord,\n    as you know.\n I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;\n    I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.\nI do not conceal your love and your faithfulness\n    from the great assembly.\n\n Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord;\n    may your love and faithfulness always protect me.\n For troubles without number surround me;\n    my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.\nThey are more than the hairs of my head,\n    and my heart fails within me.\n Be pleased to save me, Lord;\n    come quickly, Lord, to help me.\n\n May all who want to take my life\n    be put to shame and confusion;\nmay all who desire my ruin\n    be turned back in disgrace.\n May those who say to me, \"Aha!

    "Script 2": "Isaiah \n\n Who has believed our message\n    and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n He grew up before him like a tender shoot,\n    and like a root out of dry ground.\nHe had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,\n    nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.\n He was despised and rejected by mankind,\n    a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.\nLike one from whom people hide their faces\n    he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.\n\n Surely he took up our pain\n    and bore our suffering,\nyet we considered him punished by God,\n    stricken by him, and afflicted.\n But he was pierced for our transgressions,\n    he was crushed for our iniquities;\nthe punishment that brought us peace was on him,\n    and by his wounds we are healed.\n We all, like sheep, have gone astray,\n    each of us has turned to our own way;\nand the Lord has laid on him\n    the iniquity of us all.\n\n He was oppressed and afflicted,\n    yet he did not open his mouth;\nhe was led like a lamb to the slaughter,\n    and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,\n    so he did not open his mouth.\n By oppression[a] and judgment he was taken away.\n    Yet who of his generation protested?\nFor he was cut off from the land of the living;\n    for the transgression of my people he was punished.[b]\n He was assigned a grave with the wicked,\n    and with the rich in his death,\nthough he had done no violence,\n    nor was any deceit in his mouth.\n\n Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer,\n    and though the Lord makes[c] his life an offering for sin,\nhe will see his offspring and prolong his days,\n    and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.\n After he has suffered,\n    he will see the light of life[d] and be satisfied[e];\nby his knowledge[f] my righteous servant will justify many,\n    and he will bear their iniquities.\n Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,[g]\n    and he will divide the spoils with the strong,[h]\nbecause he poured out his life unto death,\n    and was numbered with the transgressors.\nFor he bore the sin of many,\n    and made intercession for the transgressors.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Hebrews :-\n\nChrist's Sacrifice Once for All\n\n The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.  Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.  But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins.  It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.",
    "Script 4": "Ezekiel :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.  I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside [a]many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.  Then will I [b]make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of [c]that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.  This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.  They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: [d]she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.\n\n Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;  whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.\n\n There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.\n\n There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.  [e]And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.  But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.\n\n There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who [f]in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.  There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; [g]in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.\n\n Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, [h]even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.  For I have put [i]his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n \n",
