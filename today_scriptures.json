    "Script 2": " The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.\n\n Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. \"I had a dream,\" he was saying. \"A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.\"\n\n His friend responded, \"This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.\"\n\n When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, \"Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands.\"  Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.\n\n \"Watch me,\" he told them. \"Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.  When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the Lord and for Gideon.'\"\n\n Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.  The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, \"A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!\"  While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.\n\n When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the Lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.",
    "Script 3": "Do Everything Without Grumbling\n\n Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,  for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.\n\n Do everything without grumbling or arguing,  so that you may become blameless and pure, \"children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.\"[a] Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky  as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.  But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.  So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.\n\n",

And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.  Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.  And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.  And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he [c]set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.  And [d]Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.\n\n And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.  Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.  And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.  And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n \n",
