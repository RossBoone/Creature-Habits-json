    "Script 2": " After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.  He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, \"My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.\"\n\n His father Isaac asked him, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am your son,\" he answered, \"your firstborn, Esau.\"\n\n Isaac trembled violently and said, \"Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!\"\n\n When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, \"Bless me--me too, my father!\"\n\n But he said, \"Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.\"\n\n Esau said, \"Isn't he rightly named Jacob[a]? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!\" Then he asked, \"Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?\"\n\n Isaac answered Esau, \"I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?\"\n\n Esau said to his father, \"Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!\" Then Esau wept aloud.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven\n\n In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach  until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.  After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.  On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.  For John baptized with[a] water, but in a few days you will be baptized with[b] the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;  and I will [a]bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their [b]birth; and they shall be there a [c]base kingdom.  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.\n\n And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.  I have given him the land of Egypt [d]as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.\n\n \n",
