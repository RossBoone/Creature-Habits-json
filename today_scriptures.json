    "Script 1": "\n? Mem\n\n Oh, how I love your law!\n    I meditate on it all day long.\n Your commands are always with me\n    and make me wiser than my enemies.\n I have more insight than all my teachers,\n    for I meditate on your statutes.\n I have more understanding than the elders,\n    for I obey your precepts.\n I have kept my feet from every evil path\n    so that I might obey your word.\n I have not departed from your laws,\n    for you yourself have taught me.\n How sweet are your words to my taste,\n    sweeter than honey to my mouth!\n I gain understanding from your precepts;\n    therefore I hate every wrong path.",
    "Script 2": "Invitations of Wisdom and Folly\n\n Wisdom has built her house;\n    she has set up[a] its seven pillars.\n She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine;\n    she has also set her table.\n She has sent out her servants, and she calls\n    from the highest point of the city,\n     ?Let all who are simple come to my house!?\nTo those who have no sense she says,\n     ?Come, eat my food\n    and drink the wine I have mixed.\n Leave your simple ways and you will live;\n    walk in the way of insight.?\n\n Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults;\n    whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse.\n Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you;\n    rebuke the wise and they will love you.\n Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still;\n    teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.\n\n The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\n    and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\n For through wisdom[b] your days will be many,\n    and years will be added to your life.\n If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you;\n    if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.\n\n Folly is an unruly woman;\n    she is simple and knows nothing.\n She sits at the door of her house,\n    on a seat at the highest point of the city,\n calling out to those who pass by,\n    who go straight on their way,\n     ?Let all who are simple come to my house!?\nTo those who have no sense she says,\n     ?Stolen water is sweet;\n    food eaten in secret is delicious!?\n But little do they know that the dead are there,\n    that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father?Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.\n\nLove and Hatred for Fellow Believers\n\n We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands.  Whoever says, ?I know him,? but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.  But if anyone obeys his word, love for God[a] is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him:  Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab?s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: [a]but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.  And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.\n\n \n",
