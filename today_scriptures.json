    "Script 1": "\nOf David. A maskil.[a]\n\n Blessed is the one\n    whose transgressions are forgiven,\n    whose sins are covered.\n Blessed is the one\n    whose sin the Lord does not count against them\n    and in whose spirit is no deceit.\n\n When I kept silent,\n    my bones wasted away\n    through my groaning all day long.\n For day and night\n    your hand was heavy on me;\nmy strength was sapped\n    as in the heat of summer.[b]\n\n Then I acknowledged my sin to you\n    and did not cover up my iniquity.\nI said, \"I will confess\n    my transgressions to the Lord.\"\nAnd you forgave\n    the guilt of my sin.\n\n Therefore let all the faithful pray to you\n    while you may be found;\nsurely the rising of the mighty waters\n    will not reach them.\n You are my hiding place;\n    you will protect me from trouble\n    and surround me with songs of deliverance.\n\n I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;\n    I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.\n Do not be like the horse or the mule,\n    which have no understanding\nbut must be controlled by bit and bridle\n    or they will not come to you.\n Many are the woes of the wicked,\n    but the Lord's unfailing love\n    surrounds the one who trusts in him.\n\n Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;\n    sing, all you who are upright in heart!\n\n",
    "Script 2": " \"Therefore,\" declares the Lord, \"I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me.  Yes,\" declares the Lord, \"I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The Lord declares.'  Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,\" declares the Lord. \"They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,\" declares the Lord.\n\nFalse Prophecy\n\n \"When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the message from the Lord?' say to them, 'What message? I will forsake you, declares the Lord.'  If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is a message from the Lord,' I will punish them and their household.  This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: 'What is the Lord's answer?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?'  But you must not mention 'a message from the Lord' again, because each one's word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God.  This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the Lord's answer to you?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?'  Although you claim, 'This is a message from the Lord,' this is what the Lord says: You used the words, 'This is a message from the Lord,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is a message from the Lord.'  Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors.  I will bring on you everlasting disgrace--everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.\"",
    "Script 3": "On Denying the Incarnation\n\n Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,  but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\n\n You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.  They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.  We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit[a] of truth and the spirit of falsehood.\n\n",
