    "Script 3": "Suffering for Being a Christian\n\n Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.  But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.  If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.  If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.  However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.  For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?  And,\n\n\"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,\n    what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?\"[a]\n\n So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer [a]to send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly [b]outweigh wisdom and honor.  A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.  Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his [c]understanding faileth him, and he saith [d]to every one that he is a fool.  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for [e]gentleness allayeth great offences.  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:  folly is set in great [f]dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.  Whoso [g]heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.  If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.  [h]If the serpent bite [i]before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in [j]the charmer.  The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.  The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of [k]his talk is mischievous madness.  A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?  The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a [l]child, and thy princes eat in the morning!  Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is [m]the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!  By slothfulness the [n]roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.  Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.\n\n \n",
