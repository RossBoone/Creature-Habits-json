    "Script 1": "\n Praise the Lord.[a]\n\nPraise the Lord from the heavens;\n    praise him in the heights above.\n Praise him, all his angels;\n    praise him, all his heavenly hosts.\n Praise him, sun and moon;\n    praise him, all you shining stars.\n Praise him, you highest heavens\n    and you waters above the skies.\n\n Let them praise the name of the Lord,\n    for at his command they were created,\n and he established them for ever and ever--\n    he issued a decree that will never pass away.\n\n Praise the Lord from the earth,\n    you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,\n lightning and hail, snow and clouds,\n    stormy winds that do his bidding,\n you mountains and all hills,\n    fruit trees and all cedars,\n wild animals and all cattle,\n    small creatures and flying birds,\n kings of the earth and all nations,\n    you princes and all rulers on earth,\n young men and women,\n    old men and children.\n\n Let them praise the name of the Lord,\n    for his name alone is exalted;\n    his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.\n And he has raised up for his people a horn,[b]\n    the praise of all his faithful servants,\n    of Israel, the people close to his heart.\n\nPraise the Lord.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " \"The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,[a][b]\n    before his deeds of old;\n I was formed long ages ago,\n    at the very beginning, when the world came to be.\n When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,\n    when there were no springs overflowing with water;\n before the mountains were settled in place,\n    before the hills, I was given birth,\n before he made the world or its fields\n    or any of the dust of the earth.\n I was there when he set the heavens in place,\n    when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,\n when he established the clouds above\n    and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,\n when he gave the sea its boundary\n    so the waters would not overstep his command,\nand when he marked out the foundations of the earth.\n     Then I was constantly[c] at his side.\nI was filled with delight day after day,\n    rejoicing always in his presence,\n rejoicing in his whole world\n    and delighting in mankind.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Faith in the Incarnate Son of God\n\n Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.  This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.  In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,  for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.  Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n This is the one who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.  For there are three that testify:  the[a] Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.  We accept human testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.  Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.  And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.  Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.  And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.",
