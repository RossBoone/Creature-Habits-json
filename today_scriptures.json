    "Script 1": "\n Why do the nations conspire[a]\n    and the peoples plot in vain?\n The kings of the earth rise up\n    and the rulers band together\n    against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,\n \"Let us break their chains\n    and throw off their shackles.\"\n\n The One enthroned in heaven laughs;\n    the Lord scoffs at them.\n He rebukes them in his anger\n    and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,\n \"I have installed my king\n    on Zion, my holy mountain.\"\n\n I will proclaim the Lord's decree:\n\nHe said to me, \"You are my son;\n    today I have become your father.\n Ask me,\n    and I will make the nations your inheritance,\n    the ends of the earth your possession.\n You will break them with a rod of iron[b];\n    you will dash them to pieces like pottery.\"\n\n Therefore, you kings, be wise;\n    be warned, you rulers of the earth.\n Serve the Lord with fear\n    and celebrate his rule with trembling.\n Kiss his son, or he will be angry\n    and your way will lead to your destruction,\nfor his wrath can flare up in a moment.\n    Blessed are all who take refuge in him.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " The Lord said to Moses, \"I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.\" Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said.\n\n And the Lord said to Moses, \"Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes  and be ready by the third day, because on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.  Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.  They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.\"\n\n After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.  Then he said to the people, \"Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.\"\n\n On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.  Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.  Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain[a] trembled violently.  As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.[b]\n\n The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up  and the Lord said to him, \"Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the Lord and many of them perish.  Even the priests, who approach the Lord, must consecrate themselves, or the Lord will break out against them.\"\n\n Moses said to the Lord, \"The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'\"\n\n The Lord replied, \"Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the Lord, or he will break out against them.\"\n\n So Moses went down to the people and told them.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.\n\n By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.  He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.  He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.  By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.  By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.  For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.  And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the [a]gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,  yet knowing that a man is not [b]justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.  For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.  For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.  I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.  I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.\n\n \n",
