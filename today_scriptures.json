    "Script 1": "\nOf Solomon.\n\n Endow the king with your justice, O God,\n    the royal son with your righteousness.\n May he judge your people in righteousness,\n    your afflicted ones with justice.\n\n May the mountains bring prosperity to the people,\n    the hills the fruit of righteousness.\n May he defend the afflicted among the people\n    and save the children of the needy;\n    may he crush the oppressor.\n May he endure[a] as long as the sun,\n    as long as the moon, through all generations.\n May he be like rain falling on a mown field,\n    like showers watering the earth.\n In his days may the righteous flourish\n    and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.\n\n May he rule from sea to sea\n    and from the River[b] to the ends of the earth.\n May the desert tribes bow before him\n    and his enemies lick the dust.\n May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores\n    bring tribute to him.\nMay the kings of Sheba and Seba\n    present him gifts.\n May all kings bow down to him\n    and all nations serve him.\n\n For he will deliver the needy who cry out,\n    the afflicted who have no one to help.\n He will take pity on the weak and the needy\n    and save the needy from death.\n He will rescue them from oppression and violence,\n    for precious is their blood in his sight.\n\n Long may he live!\n    May gold from Sheba be given him.\nMay people ever pray for him\n    and bless him all day long.\n May grain abound throughout the land;\n    on the tops of the hills may it sway.\nMay the crops flourish like Lebanon\n    and thrive[c] like the grass of the field.\n May his name endure forever;\n    may it continue as long as the sun.\n\nThen all nations will be blessed through him,[d]\n    and they will call him blessed.\n\n Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel,\n    who alone does marvelous deeds.\n Praise be to his glorious name forever;\n    may the whole earth be filled with his glory.\nAmen and Amen.\n\n This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Joshua Installed as Leader\n\n After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:  \"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.  I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.  Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates--all the Hittite country--to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.  No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.  Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.\n\n \"Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.  Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.  Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.\"",
    "Script 3": " And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets,  who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,  quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.  Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection.  Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.  They were put to death by stoning;[a] they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--  the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.\n\n These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised,  since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.\n\n: Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,  fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;  and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:  and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.  Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall [a]faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;  it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? [b]the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.  And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.  Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: [c]they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.  For there is a trial; and [d]what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which [e]entereth into their chambers.  I have set the [f]threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.  [g]Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, [h]whithersoever thy face is set.  I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a [i]place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.  Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.  In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth [j]in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.\n\n Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.  And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the [k]iniquity of the end,  thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [l]Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be [m]no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.  [n]I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.\n\n And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, [o]to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;  while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the [p]iniquity of the end.  Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of [q]thy birth, will I judge thee.  And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n \n",

    "Script 4": "Ezekiel \nAmerican Standard Version\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;  and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:  and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.  Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall [a]faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.\n\n And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;  it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? [b]the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.  And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.  Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: [c]they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.  For there is a trial; and [d]what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which [e]entereth into their chambers.  I have set the [f]threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.  [g]Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, [h]whithersoever thy face is set.  I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a [i]place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.  Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.  In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth [j]in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.\n\n Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.  And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the [k]iniquity of the end,  thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [l]Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be [m]no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.  [n]I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.\n\n And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, [o]to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;  while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the [p]iniquity of the end.  Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of [q]thy birth, will I judge thee.  And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.\n\n \nFootnotes\nEzekiel : Or, be dim\nEzekiel : Or, it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree\nEzekiel : Or, terrors by reason of the sword are upon my people\nEzekiel : Or, what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more etc.\nEzekiel : Or, compasseth them about\nEzekiel : Or, glittering\nEzekiel : Hebrew Make thyself one.\nEzekiel : Or, whither is thy face set?\nEzekiel : Hebrew hand.\nEzekiel : Or, for\nEzekiel : Or, punishment\nEzekiel : Or, I will remove etc.\nEzekiel : Hebrew not this.\nEzekiel : Hebrew An overthrow, overthrow, overthrow, will I make it.\nEzekiel : Or, to the uttermost\nEzekiel : Or, punishment\nEzekiel : Or, thine origin",

    "Script 2": "Joshua :-\n\nJoshua Installed as Leader\n\n After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:  \"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.  I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.  Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates--all the Hittite country--to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.  No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.  Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.\n\n \"Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.  Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.  Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.\"",
    "Script 3": "Hebrews :-:\n\n And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets,  who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,  quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.  Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection.  Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.  They were put to death by stoning;[a] they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--  the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.\n\n These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised,  since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.\n\n: Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,  fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n",
