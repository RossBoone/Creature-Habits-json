Call for the wailing women to come;\n    send for the most skillful of them.\n Let them come quickly\n    and wail over us\ntill our eyes overflow with tears\n    and water streams from our eyelids.\n The sound of wailing is heard from Zion:\n    'How ruined we are!\n    How great is our shame!\nWe must leave our land\n    because our houses are in ruins.'\"\n\n Now, you women, hear the word of the Lord;\n    open your ears to the words of his mouth.\nTeach your daughters how to wail;\n    teach one another a lament.\n Death has climbed in through our windows\n    and has entered our fortresses;\nit has removed the children from the streets\n    and the young men from the public squares.\n\n Say, \"This is what the Lord declares:\n\n\"'Dead bodies will lie\n    like dung on the open field,\nlike cut grain behind the reaper,\n    with no one to gather them.'\"\n\n This is what the Lord says:\n\n\"Let not the wise boast of their wisdom\n    or the strong boast of their strength\n    or the rich boast of their riches,\n but let the one who boasts boast about this:\n    that they have the understanding to know me,\nthat I am the Lord, who exercises kindness,\n    justice and righteousness on earth,\n    for in these I delight,\"\ndeclares the Lord.\n\n \"The days are coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh--  Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places.[a] For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": "A Final Charge to Timothy\n\n You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,  persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.  In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,  while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.  But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,  and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the [a]hardness of his face is changed.  I counsel thee, Keep the king's command, and that in regard of the oath of God.  Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.  For the king's word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgment:  for to every [b]purpose there is a time and judgment; because the [c]misery of man is great upon him:  for he knoweth not that which shall be; [d]for who can tell him how it shall be?  There is no man that hath power over the [e]spirit to retain the [f]spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge [g]in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [h]there is a time wherein one man hath power over another [i]to his hurt.  So I saw the wicked buried, [j]and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is [k]fully set in them to do evil.  Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:  but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: [l]for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.  When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the [m]business that is done upon the earth [n](for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),  then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.\n\n \n",

Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.  For the king's word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgment:  for to every [b]purpose there is a time and judgment; because the [c]misery of man is great upon him:  for he knoweth not that which shall be; [d]for who can tell him how it shall be?  There is no man that hath power over the [e]spirit to retain the [f]spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge [g]in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [h]there is a time wherein one man hath power over another [i]to his hurt.  So I saw the wicked buried, [j]and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is [k]fully set in them to do evil.  Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:  but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: [l]for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.  When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the [m]business that is done upon the earth [n](for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),  then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.\n\n \n",
