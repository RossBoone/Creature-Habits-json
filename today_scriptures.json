    "Script 2": "The Ark in Ashdod and Ekron\n\n After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.  Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.  When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.  But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.  That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.\n\n The Lord's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.[a]  When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, \"The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.\"  So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, \"What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?\"\n\nThey answered, \"Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.\" So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.\n\n But after they had moved it, the Lord's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.[b]  So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\n\nAs the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, \"They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.\"  So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, \"Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it[c] will kill us and our people.\" For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it.  Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering.  Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.  You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.  So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.\n\n You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.  For,\n\n\"In just a little while,\n    he who is coming will come\n    and will not delay.\"[a]\n\n And,\n\n\"But my righteous[b] one will live by faith.\n    And I take no pleasure\n    in the one who shrinks back.\"[c]\n\n But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And God wrought special [a]miracles by the hands of Paul:  insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.  But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.  And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I [b]know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.  And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.\n\n \n",
