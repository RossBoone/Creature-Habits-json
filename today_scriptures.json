    "Script 1": "\nOf Solomon.\n\n Endow the king with your justice, O God,\n    the royal son with your righteousness.\n May he judge your people in righteousness,\n    your afflicted ones with justice.\n\n May the mountains bring prosperity to the people,\n    the hills the fruit of righteousness.\n May he defend the afflicted among the people\n    and save the children of the needy;\n    may he crush the oppressor.\n May he endure[a] as long as the sun,\n    as long as the moon, through all generations.\n May he be like rain falling on a mown field,\n    like showers watering the earth.\n In his days may the righteous flourish\n    and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.\n\n May he rule from sea to sea\n    and from the River[b] to the ends of the earth.\n May the desert tribes bow before him\n    and his enemies lick the dust.\n May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores\n    bring tribute to him.\nMay the kings of Sheba and Seba\n    present him gifts.\n May all kings bow down to him\n    and all nations serve him.\n\n For he will deliver the needy who cry out,\n    the afflicted who have no one to help.\n He will take pity on the weak and the needy\n    and save the needy from death.\n He will rescue them from oppression and violence,\n    for precious is their blood in his sight.\n\n Long may he live!\n    May gold from Sheba be given him.\nMay people ever pray for him\n    and bless him all day long.\n May grain abound throughout the land;\n    on the tops of the hills may it sway.\nMay the crops flourish like Lebanon\n    and thrive[c] like the grass of the field.\n May his name endure forever;\n    may it continue as long as the sun.\n\nThen all nations will be blessed through him,[d]\n    and they will call him blessed.\n\n Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel,\n    who alone does marvelous deeds.\n Praise be to his glorious name forever;\n    may the whole earth be filled with his glory.\nAmen and Amen.\n\n This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Moses and the Burning Bush\n\n Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.  There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.  So Moses thought, \"I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up.\"\n\n When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, \"Moses! Moses!\"\n\nAnd Moses said, \"Here I am.\"\n\n \"Do not come any closer,\" God said. \"Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.\"",

He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.  He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.  By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.  By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.\n\n By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.\n\n By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.\n\n By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.[a]\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.  And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.  The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.  Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.  And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.  And he knew their [a]palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.  Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.  And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.\n\n Thy mother was like a vine, [b]in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.  And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and [c]their stature was exalted among the [d]thick boughs, and [e]they were seen in [f]their height with the multitude of [g]their branches.  But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.  And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.  And fire is gone out of [h]the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.\n\n \n",
