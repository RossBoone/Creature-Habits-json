    "Script 1": "\n By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept\n    when we remembered Zion.\n There on the poplars\n    we hung our harps,\n for there our captors asked us for songs,\n    our tormentors demanded songs of joy;\n    they said, \"Sing us one of the songs of Zion!\"\n\n How can we sing the songs of the Lord\n    while in a foreign land?\n If I forget you, Jerusalem,\n    may my right hand forget its skill.\n May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth\n    if I do not remember you,\nif I do not consider Jerusalem\n    my highest joy.\n\n Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did\n    on the day Jerusalem fell.\n\"Tear it down,\" they cried,\n    \"tear it down to its foundations!\"\n Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,\n    happy is the one who repays you\n    according to what you have done to us.\n Happy is the one who seizes your infants\n    and dashes them against the rocks.\n\nPsalm [a]\n\nOf David.\n\n Do not fret because of those who are evil\n    or be envious of those who do wrong;\n for like the grass they will soon wither,\n    like green plants they will soon die away.\n\n Trust in the Lord and do good;\n    dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.\n Take delight in the Lord,\n    and he will give you the desires of your heart.\n\n Commit your way to the Lord;\n    trust in him and he will do this:\n He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,\n    your vindication like the noonday sun.\n\n Be still before the Lord\n    and wait patiently for him;\ndo not fret when people succeed in their ways,\n    when they carry out their wicked schemes.\n\n Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;\n    do not fret--it leads only to evil.\n For those who are evil will be destroyed,\n    but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " [a]How deserted lies the city,\n    once so full of people!\nHow like a widow is she,\n    who once was great among the nations!\nShe who was queen among the provinces\n    has now become a slave.\n\n Bitterly she weeps at night,\n    tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong all her lovers\n    there is no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have betrayed her;\n    they have become her enemies.\n\n After affliction and harsh labor,\n    Judah has gone into exile.\nShe dwells among the nations;\n    she finds no resting place.\nAll who pursue her have overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress.\n\n The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to her appointed festivals.\nAll her gateways are desolate,\n    her priests groan,\nher young women grieve,\n    and she is in bitter anguish.\n\n Her foes have become her masters;\n    her enemies are at ease.\nThe Lord has brought her grief\n    because of her many sins.\nHer children have gone into exile,\n    captive before the foe.\n\n All the splendor has departed\n    from Daughter Zion.\nHer princes are like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nin weakness they have fled\n    before the pursuer.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,\n\n To Timothy, my dear son:\n\nGrace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nThanksgiving\n\n I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.  Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.  I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.\n\nAppeal for Loyalty to Paul and the Gospel\n\n For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.  For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.  So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.  He has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,  but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.  And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.  That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.\n\n What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.  Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.",
    "Script 4": "\n The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\"\n\n He replied, \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.\n\n \"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'?  Won't he rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?  Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?  So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'\"",

    "Script 2": "Lamentations :-\n\n [a]How deserted lies the city,\n    once so full of people!\nHow like a widow is she,\n    who once was great among the nations!\nShe who was queen among the provinces\n    has now become a slave.\n\n Bitterly she weeps at night,\n    tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong all her lovers\n    there is no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have betrayed her;\n    they have become her enemies.\n\n After affliction and harsh labor,\n    Judah has gone into exile.\nShe dwells among the nations;\n    she finds no resting place.\nAll who pursue her have overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress.\n\n The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to her appointed festivals.\nAll her gateways are desolate,\n    her priests groan,\nher young women grieve,\n    and she is in bitter anguish.\n\n Her foes have become her masters;\n    her enemies are at ease.\nThe Lord has brought her grief\n    because of her many sins.\nHer children have gone into exile,\n    captive before the foe.\n\n All the splendor has departed\n    from Daughter Zion.\nHer princes are like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nin weakness they have fled\n    before the pursuer.\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Timothy :-\n\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,\n\n To Timothy, my dear son:\n\nGrace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nThanksgiving\n\n I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.  Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.  I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.\n\nAppeal for Loyalty to Paul and the Gospel\n\n For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.  For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.  So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.  He has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,  but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.  And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.  That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.\n\n What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.  Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.",
    "Script 4": "Luke :-\n\n The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\"\n\n He replied, \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.\n\n \"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'?  Won't he rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?  Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?  So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'\"",
