    "Script 3": "Christ Crucified Is God's Power and Wisdom\n\n For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written:\n\n\"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;\n    the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.\"[a]\n\n Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.  Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,  but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,  but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.\n\n Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.  But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.  God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,  so that no one may boast before him.  It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.  Therefore, as it is written: \"Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.\"[b]\n\n",
    "Script 4": "\nIntroduction to the Sermon on the Mount\n\n Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,  and he began to teach them.\n\nThe Beatitudes\nHe said:\n\n \"Blessed are the poor in spirit,\n    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n Blessed are those who mourn,\n    for they will be comforted.\n Blessed are the meek,\n    for they will inherit the earth.\n Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\n    for they will be filled.\n Blessed are the merciful,\n    for they will be shown mercy.\n Blessed are the pure in heart,\n    for they will see God.\n Blessed are the peacemakers,\n    for they will be called children of God.\n Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,\n    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\n \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.  Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.",
