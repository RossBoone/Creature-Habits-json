    "Script 1": "\n Why do the nations conspire[a]\n    and the peoples plot in vain?\n The kings of the earth rise up\n    and the rulers band together\n    against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,\n \"Let us break their chains\n    and throw off their shackles.\"\n\n The One enthroned in heaven laughs;\n    the Lord scoffs at them.\n He rebukes them in his anger\n    and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,\n \"I have installed my king\n    on Zion, my holy mountain.\"\n\n I will proclaim the Lord's decree:\n\nHe said to me, \"You are my son;\n    today I have become your father.\n Ask me,\n    and I will make the nations your inheritance,\n    the ends of the earth your possession.\n You will break them with a rod of iron[b];\n    you will dash them to pieces like pottery.\"\n\n Therefore, you kings, be wise;\n    be warned, you rulers of the earth.\n Serve the Lord with fear\n    and celebrate his rule with trembling.\n Kiss his son, or he will be angry\n    and your way will lead to your destruction,\nfor his wrath can flare up in a moment.\n    Blessed are all who take refuge in him.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Ahab said to Elijah, \"So you have found me, my enemy!\"\n\n\"I have found you,\" he answered, \"because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.  He says, 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.[a]  I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin.'\n\n \"And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of[b] Jezreel.'\n\n \"Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country.\"\n\n (There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, urged on by Jezebel his wife.  He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the Lord drove out before Israel.)\n\n When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.\n\n Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:  \"Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son.\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": " As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.  They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what \"rising from the dead\" meant.\n\n And they asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\"\n\n Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?  But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.\"",
