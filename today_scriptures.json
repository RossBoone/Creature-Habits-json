    "Script 1": "\n But you, Sovereign Lord,\n    help me for your name's sake;\n    out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.\n For I am poor and needy,\n    and my heart is wounded within me.\n I fade away like an evening shadow;\n    I am shaken off like a locust.\n My knees give way from fasting;\n    my body is thin and gaunt.\n I am an object of scorn to my accusers;\n    when they see me, they shake their heads.\n\n Help me, Lord my God;\n    save me according to your unfailing love.\n Let them know that it is your hand,\n    that you, Lord, have done it.\n While they curse, may you bless;\n    may those who attack me be put to shame,\n    but may your servant rejoice.\n May my accusers be clothed with disgrace\n    and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.\n\n With my mouth I will greatly extol the Lord;\n    in the great throng of worshipers I will praise him.\n For he stands at the right hand of the needy,\n    to save their lives from those who would condemn them.",
    "Script 2": " As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will reign over you with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.  I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered--with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.  I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you.  As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign Lord.  I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.  I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.\n\n \"'As for you, people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols.  For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord, there in the land all the people of Israel will serve me, and there I will accept them. There I will require your offerings and your choice gifts,[a] along with all your holy sacrifices.  I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will be proved holy through you in the sight of the nations.  Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your ancestors.  There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done.  You will know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for my name's sake and not according to your evil ways and your corrupt practices, you people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.'\"\n\n",
    "Script 3": " On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.  The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.  But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, \"Get up and stand in front of everyone.\" So he got up and stood there.\n\n Then Jesus said to them, \"I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?\"\n\n He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He did so, and his hand was completely restored.  But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and [a]offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
