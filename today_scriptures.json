    "Script 1": "Psalm [a]\n\nFor the director of music. A psalm of David. A song.\n\n Praise awaits[b] you, our God, in Zion;\n    to you our vows will be fulfilled.\n You who answer prayer,\n    to you all people will come.\n When we were overwhelmed by sins,\n    you forgave[c] our transgressions.\n Blessed are those you choose\n    and bring near to live in your courts!\nWe are filled with the good things of your house,\n    of your holy temple.\n\n You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds,\n    God our Savior,\nthe hope of all the ends of the earth\n    and of the farthest seas,\n who formed the mountains by your power,\n    having armed yourself with strength,\n who stilled the roaring of the seas,\n    the roaring of their waves,\n    and the turmoil of the nations.\n The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders;\n    where morning dawns, where evening fades,\n    you call forth songs of joy.\n\n You care for the land and water it;\n    you enrich it abundantly.\nThe streams of God are filled with water\n    to provide the people with grain,\n    for so you have ordained it.[d]\n You drench its furrows and level its ridges;\n    you soften it with showers and bless its crops.\n You crown the year with your bounty,\n    and your carts overflow with abundance.\n The grasslands of the wilderness overflow;\n    the hills are clothed with gladness.\n The meadows are covered with flocks\n    and the valleys are mantled with grain;\n    they shout for joy and sing.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Jeremiah :-, -\n\n Although our sins testify against us,\n    do something, Lord, for the sake of your name.\nFor we have often rebelled;\n    we have sinned against you.\n You who are the hope of Israel,\n    its Savior in times of distress,\nwhy are you like a stranger in the land,\n    like a traveler who stays only a night?\n Why are you like a man taken by surprise,\n    like a warrior powerless to save?\nYou are among us, Lord,\n    and we bear your name;\n    do not forsake us!\n\n This is what the Lord says about this people:\n\n\"They greatly love to wander;\n    they do not restrain their feet.\nSo the Lord does not accept them;\n    he will now remember their wickedness\n    and punish them for their sins.\" \n\n...\n\n Have you rejected Judah completely?\n    Do you despise Zion?\nWhy have you afflicted us\n    so that we cannot be healed?\nWe hoped for peace\n    but no good has come,\nfor a time of healing\n    but there is only terror.\n We acknowledge our wickedness, Lord,\n    and the guilt of our ancestors;\n    we have indeed sinned against you.\n For the sake of your name do not despise us;\n    do not dishonor your glorious throne.\nRemember your covenant with us\n    and do not break it.\n Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?\n    Do the skies themselves send down showers?\nNo, it is you, Lord our God.\n    Therefore our hope is in you,\n    for you are the one who does all this.\n\nJoel :-\n\n Be glad, people of Zion,\n    rejoice in the Lord your God,\nfor he has given you the autumn rains\n    because he is faithful.\nHe sends you abundant showers,\n    both autumn and spring rains, as before.\n The threshing floors will be filled with grain;\n    the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.\n\n \"I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten--\n    the great locust and the young locust,\n    the other locusts and the locust swarm[a]--\nmy great army that I sent among you.\n You will have plenty to eat, until you are full,\n    and you will praise the name of the Lord your God,\n    who has worked wonders for you;\nnever again will my people be shamed.\n Then you will know that I am in Israel,\n    that I am the Lord your God,\n    and that there is no other;\nnever again will my people be shamed.\n\nThe Day of the Lord\n\n \"And afterward,\n    I will pour out my Spirit on all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy,\n    your old men will dream dreams,\n    your young men will see visions.\n Even on my servants, both men and women,\n    I will pour out my Spirit in those days.\n I will show wonders in the heavens\n    and on the earth,\n    blood and fire and billows of smoke.\n The sun will be turned to darkness\n    and the moon to blood\n    before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\n And everyone who calls\n    on the name of the Lord will be saved;\nfor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\n    there will be deliverance,\n    as the Lord has said,\neven among the survivors\n    whom the Lord calls.[b]\n\n",
    "Script 3": " Timothy :-,-\n\n For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near.  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.  Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.\n\n...\n\n At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.  But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.  The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Luke :-\n\nThe Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector\n\n To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:  \"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.  I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'\n\n \"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'\n\n \"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"",
