    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. A psalm of David.\n\n The king rejoices in your strength, Lord.\n    How great is his joy in the victories you give!\n\n You have granted him his heart's desire\n    and have not withheld the request of his lips.[b]\n You came to greet him with rich blessings\n    and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.\n He asked you for life, and you gave it to him--\n    length of days, for ever and ever.\n Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;\n    you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.\n Surely you have granted him unending blessings\n    and made him glad with the joy of your presence.\n For the king trusts in the Lord;\n    through the unfailing love of the Most High\n    he will not be shaken.\n\n Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;\n    your right hand will seize your foes.\n When you appear for battle,\n    you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.\nThe Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,\n    and his fire will consume them.\n You will destroy their descendants from the earth,\n    their posterity from mankind.\n Though they plot evil against you\n    and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.\n You will make them turn their backs\n    when you aim at them with drawn bow.\n\n Be exalted in your strength, Lord;\n    we will sing and praise your might.\n\n",
    "Script 2": " Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,\n    little Israel, do not fear,\nfor I myself will help you,\" declares the Lord,\n    your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\n \"See, I will make you into a threshing sledge,\n    new and sharp, with many teeth.\nYou will thresh the mountains and crush them,\n    and reduce the hills to chaff.\n You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up,\n    and a gale will blow them away.\nBut you will rejoice in the Lord\n    and glory in the Holy One of Israel.\n\n \"The poor and needy search for water,\n    but there is none;\n    their tongues are parched with thirst.\nBut I the Lord will answer them;\n    I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.\n I will make rivers flow on barren heights,\n    and springs within the valleys.\nI will turn the desert into pools of water,\n    and the parched ground into springs.\n I will put in the desert\n    the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive.\nI will set junipers in the wasteland,\n    the fir and the cypress together,\n so that people may see and know,\n    may consider and understand,\nthat the hand of the Lord has done this,\n    that the Holy One of Israel has created it.",
    "Script 3": "Paul the Minister to the Gentiles\n\n I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.  Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me  to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\n\n Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.  I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done--  by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.  It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.  Rather, as it is written:\n\n\"Those who were not told about him will see,\n    and those who have not heard will understand.\"[a]\n\n",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And bring thou near unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.  And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty.  And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.  And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of checker work, a [a]mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.  And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen.\n\n And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skilful workman.  It shall have two shoulder-pieces joined to the two ends thereof, that it may be joined together.  And the skilfully woven band, which is upon it, wherewith to gird it on, shall be like the work thereof and of the same piece; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  And thou shalt take two [b]onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:  six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth.  With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be inclosed in settings of gold.  And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.  And thou shalt make settings of gold,  and two chains of pure gold; like cords shalt thou make them, of wreathen work: and thou shalt put the wreathen chains on the settings.\n\n And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilful workman; like the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.  Foursquare it shall be and double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof.  And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of [c]sardius, topaz, and [d]carbuncle shall be the first row;  and the second row an [e]emerald, a sapphire, and a [f]diamond;  and the third row a [g]jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;  and the fourth row a [h]beryl, and an [i]onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings.  And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes.  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.  And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.  And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in the forepart thereof.  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward.  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.  And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.\n\n \n",

    "Script 2": "Isaiah :-\n\n Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,\n    little Israel, do not fear,\nfor I myself will help you,\" declares the Lord,\n    your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\n \"See, I will make you into a threshing sledge,\n    new and sharp, with many teeth.\nYou will thresh the mountains and crush them,\n    and reduce the hills to chaff.\n You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up,\n    and a gale will blow them away.\nBut you will rejoice in the Lord\n    and glory in the Holy One of Israel.\n\n \"The poor and needy search for water,\n    but there is none;\n    their tongues are parched with thirst.\nBut I the Lord will answer them;\n    I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.\n I will make rivers flow on barren heights,\n    and springs within the valleys.\nI will turn the desert into pools of water,\n    and the parched ground into springs.\n I will put in the desert\n    the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive.\nI will set junipers in the wasteland,\n    the fir and the cypress together,\n so that people may see and know,\n    may consider and understand,\nthat the hand of the Lord has done this,\n    that the Holy One of Israel has created it.",
    "Script 3": "Romans :-\n\nPaul the Minister to the Gentiles\n\n I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.  Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me  to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\n\n Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.  I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done--  by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.  It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.  Rather, as it is written:\n\n\"Those who were not told about him will see,\n    and those who have not heard will understand.\"[a]\n\n",
    "Script 4": "Exodus :-\nAmerican Standard Version\n And bring thou near unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.  And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty.  And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.  And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of checker work, a [a]mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.  And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen.\n\n And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skilful workman.  It shall have two shoulder-pieces joined to the two ends thereof, that it may be joined together.  And the skilfully woven band, which is upon it, wherewith to gird it on, shall be like the work thereof and of the same piece; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  And thou shalt take two [b]onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:  six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth.  With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be inclosed in settings of gold.  And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.  And thou shalt make settings of gold,  and two chains of pure gold; like cords shalt thou make them, of wreathen work: and thou shalt put the wreathen chains on the settings.\n\n And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilful workman; like the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.  Foursquare it shall be and double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof.  And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of [c]sardius, topaz, and [d]carbuncle shall be the first row;  and the second row an [e]emerald, a sapphire, and a [f]diamond;  and the third row a [g]jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;  and the fourth row a [h]beryl, and an [i]onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings.  And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes.  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.  And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.  And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in the forepart thereof.  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward.  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.  And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.\n\n \n",
