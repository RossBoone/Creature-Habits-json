    "Script 1": "\nA song of ascents. Of David.\n\n I rejoiced with those who said to me,\n    \"Let us go to the house of the Lord.\"\n Our feet are standing\n    in your gates, Jerusalem.\n\n Jerusalem is built like a city\n    that is closely compacted together.\n That is where the tribes go up--\n    the tribes of the Lord--\nto praise the name of the Lord\n    according to the statute given to Israel.\n There stand the thrones for judgment,\n    the thrones of the house of David.\n\n Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:\n    \"May those who love you be secure.\n May there be peace within your walls\n    and security within your citadels.\"\n For the sake of my family and friends,\n    I will say, \"Peace be within you.\"\n For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,\n    I will seek your prosperity.",
    "Script 2": "Wickedness in the World\n\n When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,  the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.  Then the Lord said, \"My Spirit will not contend with[a] humans forever, for they are mortal[b]; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.\"\n\n The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.\n\n The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.  The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.  So the Lord said, \"I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created--and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground--for I regret that I have made them.\"  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.\n\nNoah and the Flood\n\n This is the account of Noah and his family.\n\nNoah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.  Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.\n\n",
    "Script 3": "Faith in Action\n\n Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.  This is what the ancients were commended for.\n\n By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.\n\n By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.\n\n By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: \"He could not be found, because God had taken him away.\"[a] For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.  And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.\n\n By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.\n\n",
