I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.\"\n\n Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, \"Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?\"  And Abraham said to God, \"If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!\"\n\n Then God said, \"Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.[a] I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.  And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers.

    "Script 3": "Paul's Concern for the Galatians\n\n Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.  But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces[a]? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?  You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!  I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.\n\n I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.  As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you,  and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.  Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.  Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?\n\n Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.  It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.  My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,  how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!\n\n",

But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:  and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
