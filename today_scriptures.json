He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.  \"Truly I tell you,\" he said, \"this poor widow has put in more than all the others.  All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\"",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n The priests the Levites, [a]even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.  And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.  And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.  The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.  For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever.\n\n And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;  then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah.  They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.\n\n When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.  There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,  or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.  For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.  Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.  For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.\n\n \n",
