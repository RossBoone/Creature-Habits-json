    "Script 2": "Cleansing From Defiling Molds\n\n The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,  \"When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mold in a house in that land,  the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, 'I have seen something that looks like a defiling mold in my house.'  The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mold, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house.  He is to examine the mold on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall,  the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.  On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mold has spread on the walls,  he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.  He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.  Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.\n\n \"If the defiling mold reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,  the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mold has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mold; the house is unclean.  It must be torn down--its stones, timbers and all the plaster--and taken out of the town to an unclean place.\n\n \"Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening.  Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.\n\n \"But if the priest comes to examine it and the mold has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the defiling mold is gone.  To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop.  He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.  Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.  He shall purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn.  Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.\"",
    "Script 3": " What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.  Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.\n\nExamples of Disloyalty and Loyalty\n\n You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.\n\n May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.  On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.  May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.\n\n And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;  and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:  even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?  Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,  and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not [a]given unto them:  therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;  and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.\n\n \n",
