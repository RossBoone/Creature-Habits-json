    "Script 1": "\n? Teth\n\n Do good to your servant\n    according to your word, Lord.\n Teach me knowledge and good judgment,\n    for I trust your commands.\n Before I was afflicted I went astray,\n    but now I obey your word.\n You are good, and what you do is good;\n    teach me your decrees.\n Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies,\n    I keep your precepts with all my heart.\n Their hearts are callous and unfeeling,\n    but I delight in your law.\n It was good for me to be afflicted\n    so that I might learn your decrees.\n The law from your mouth is more precious to me\n    than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.",
    "Script 2": " The Lord Almighty has a day in store\n    for all the proud and lofty,\nfor all that is exalted\n    (and they will be humbled),\n for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty,\n    and all the oaks of Bashan,\n for all the towering mountains\n    and all the high hills,\n for every lofty tower\n    and every fortified wall,\n for every trading ship[a]\n    and every stately vessel.\n The arrogance of man will be brought low\n    and human pride humbled;\nthe Lord alone will be exalted in that day,\n\n",

An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe[b] and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.  Since an overseer manages God's household, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.  Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.  He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.\n\n",
