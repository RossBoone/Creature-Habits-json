    "Script 1": "\nFor the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.\n\n Hear this, all you peoples;\n    listen, all who live in this world,\n both low and high,\n    rich and poor alike:\n My mouth will speak words of wisdom;\n    the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.\n I will turn my ear to a proverb;\n    with the harp I will expound my riddle:\n\n Why should I fear when evil days come,\n    when wicked deceivers surround me--\n those who trust in their wealth\n    and boast of their great riches?\n No one can redeem the life of another\n    or give to God a ransom for them--\n the ransom for a life is costly,\n    no payment is ever enough--\n so that they should live on forever\n    and not see decay.\n For all can see that the wise die,\n    that the foolish and the senseless also perish,\n    leaving their wealth to others.\n Their tombs will remain their houses[b] forever,\n    their dwellings for endless generations,\n    though they had[c] named lands after themselves.\n\n People, despite their wealth, do not endure;\n    they are like the beasts that perish.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Saying \n\n Do not envy the wicked,\n    do not desire their company;\n for their hearts plot violence,\n    and their lips talk about making trouble.\n\nSaying \n\n By wisdom a house is built,\n    and through understanding it is established;\n through knowledge its rooms are filled\n    with rare and beautiful treasures.\n\nSaying \n\n The wise prevail through great power,\n    and those who have knowledge muster their strength.\n Surely you need guidance to wage war,\n    and victory is won through many advisers.\n\nSaying \n\n Wisdom is too high for fools;\n    in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths.\n\nSaying \n\n Whoever plots evil\n    will be known as a schemer.\n The schemes of folly are sin,\n    and people detest a mocker.\n\nSaying \n\n If you falter in a time of trouble,\n    how small is your strength!\n Rescue those being led away to death;\n    hold back those staggering toward slaughter.\n If you say, \"But we knew nothing about this,\"\n    does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?\nDoes not he who guards your life know it?\n    Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?",
    "Script 3": "Instructions for Christian Living\n\n So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.  They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.  Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.\n\n That, however, is not the way of life you learned  when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.  You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;  to be made new in the attitude of your minds;  and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.",
    "Script 4": "American Standard Version\n And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.  And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.\n\n Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.\n\n The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.\n",
