The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.

And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.  Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.  And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.  And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.  And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was [a]stubborn, and he did not let the people go.\n\n And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of [b]ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.  And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.  And Jehovah [c]hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.\n\n \n",
