Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath[a]; humans have no advantage over animals.

Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.\n\n Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;  who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:  because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
