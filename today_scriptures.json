    "Script 1": "\nA psalm. For giving grateful praise.\n\n Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.\n     Worship the Lord with gladness;\n    come before him with joyful songs.\n Know that the Lord is God.\n    It is he who made us, and we are his[a];\n    we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.\n\n Enter his gates with thanksgiving\n    and his courts with praise;\n    give thanks to him and praise his name.\n For the Lord is good and his love endures forever;\n    his faithfulness continues through all generations.\n\n",
    "Script 2": "Firstfruits and Tithes\n\n When you have entered the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it,  take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the Lord your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name  and say to the priest in office at the time, \"I declare today to the Lord your God that I have come to the land the Lord swore to our ancestors to give us.\"  The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God.  Then you shall declare before the Lord your God: \"My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous.  But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor.  Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression.  So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders.  He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;  and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, Lord, have given me.\" Place the basket before the Lord your God and bow down before him.  Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your household.",
    "Script 3": "Final Exhortations\n\n Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!  Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.  Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n\n Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.  Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.",
    "Script 4": "\nJesus the Bread of Life\n\n When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.  Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\"\n\n Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\"\n\n Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\"\n\n So they asked him, \"What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?  Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'[a]\"\n\n Jesus said to them, \"Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.  For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\"\n\n \"Sir,\" they said, \"always give us this bread.\"\n\n Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.\n\n",
