I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. 2 I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.\n\n3 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, \"Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\" 5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.\n\n8 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends",

So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 4 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 5 Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.\n\n6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. 7 So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city",

Who then offereth willingly [b]to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?\n\n6 Then the princes of the fathers' houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly; 7 and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. 8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah",

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\n\n8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\n\n13 And now these three remain",

David and his men were far back in the cave. 4 The men said, \"This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said[b] to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'\" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.\n\n5 Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. 6 He said to his men, \"The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.\" 7 With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.\n\n8 Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, \"My lord the king!\" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 9 He said to Saul, \"Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'? 10 This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord's anointed.' 11 See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. 12 May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. 13 As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.\n\n14 \"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 15 May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.\"\n\n16 When David finished saying this, Saul asked, \"Is that your voice, David my son?\" And he wept aloud. 17 \"You are more righteous than I,\" he said. \"You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. 18 You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. 19 When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. 20 I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 21 Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family.\"\n\n22 So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.\n\nRead full chapter\nFootnotes\n1 Samuel 24",

This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 2 He had seven sons and three daughters, 3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.\n\n4 His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, \"Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.\" This was Job's regular custom.\n\n6 One day the angels[a] came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[b] also came with them. 7 The Lord said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\"\n\nSatan answered the Lord, \"From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.\"\n\n8 Then the Lord said to Satan, \"Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.\"\n\n9 \"Does Job fear God for nothing?\" Satan replied. 10 \"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.\"\n\n12 The Lord said to Satan, \"Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.\"\n\nThen Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.\n\n13 One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, 14 a messenger came to Job and said, \"The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 15 and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"\n\n16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, \"The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"\n\n17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, \"The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"\n\n18 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, \"Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, 19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"\n\n20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 21 and said",

On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.\n\n2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.\n\n4 Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\"\n\n5 \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied.\n\n\"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) 6 When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground.\n\n7 Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\"\n\n\"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they said.\n\n8 Jesus answered, \"I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\" 9 This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled",

It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.\"\n\n3 Then Queen Esther answered, \"If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life--this is my petition. And spare my people--this is my request. 4 For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.[a]\"\n\n5 King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, \"Who is he? Where is he--the man who has dared to do such a thing?\"\n\n6 Esther said, \"An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!\"\n\nThen Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 7 The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.\n\n8 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.\n\nThe king exclaimed, \"Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?\"\n\nAs soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, \"A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits[b] stands by Haman's house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Impale him on it!\" 10 So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.\n\nFootnotes\nEsther 7",

And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. 2 The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman's estate.\n\n3 Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. 4 Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.\n\n5 \"If it pleases the king,\" she said, \"and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces. 6 For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?\"\n\n7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, \"Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up. 8 Now write another decree in the king's name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king's signet ring--for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.\"\n\n9 At once the royal secretaries were summoned--on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.[a] These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language. 10 Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king's signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.\n\n11 The king's edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,[b] and to plunder the property of their enemies. 12 The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 13 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.\n\n14 The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king's command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.\n\nThe Triumph of the Jews\n15 When Mordecai left the king's presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. 16 For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. 17 In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.\n\nFootnotes\nEsther 8",

And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.\n\n4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire [a]first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah. 5 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king. 6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him? 7 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah",

He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 3 and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke. 4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, \"Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.\"\n\n5 Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. 6 And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, \"There will be no more delay! 7 But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.\"\n\n8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more",

Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. 4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain. 6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel. 7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel. 8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. 9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.\n\n11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord",

These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia[a] and put in the treasure house of his god.\n\n3 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king's service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility-- 4 young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.[b] 5 The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.\n\n6 Among those who were chosen were some from Judah",

And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant! 7 And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the [a]land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 8 And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?\n\n9 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son. 10 And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have bread to eat",

So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 4 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.\n\n6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. 7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate",

And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. 3 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.\n\n5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came. 6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David",

Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.\n\n4 When Esther's eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 5 Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.\n\n6 So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate. 7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. 8 He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.\n\n9 Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. 10 Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai, 11 \"All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law",

So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.\n\n3 Then the king asked, \"What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.\"\n\n4 \"If it pleases the king,\" replied Esther, \"let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.\"\n\n5 \"Bring Haman at once,\" the king said, \"so that we may do what Esther asks.\"\n\nSo the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. 6 As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, \"Now what is your petition?

They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 4 But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. 5 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.\n\n6 The Lord's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.[a] 7 When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, \"The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.\" 8 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, \"What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?\"\n\nThey answered, \"Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.\" So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.\n\n9 But after they had moved it, the Lord's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.[b] 10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\n\nAs the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, \"They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.\" 11 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, \"Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it[c] will kill us and our people.\" For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it. 12 Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.\n\nFootnotes\na. 1 Samuel 5",

All that cometh is vanity. 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 10 Therefore remove [i]sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.\n\n \nFootnotes\nEcclesiastes 11",

So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 6 And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, [c]that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But [d]thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.\n\n7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. 8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall",

That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. 3 Now, Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.\"\n\n4 But the Lord replied, \"Is it right for you to be angry?\"\n\n5 Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city. 6 Then the Lord God provided a leafy plant[a] and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant. 7 But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. 8 When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, \"It would be better for me to die than to live.\"\n\n9 But God said to Jonah, \"Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?\"\n\n\"It is,\" he said. \"And I'm so angry I wish I were dead.\"\n\n10 But the Lord said, \"You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. 11 And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left--and also many animals?\"\n\nFootnotes\na.

Night is coming, when no one can work. 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"\n\n6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. 7 \"Go,\" he told him, \"wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (this word means \"Sent\"). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.\n\n8 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, \"Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\" 9 Some claimed that he was.\n\nOthers said, \"No, he only looks like him.\"\n\nBut he himself insisted, \"I am the man.\"\n\n10 \"How then were your eyes opened?\" they asked.\n\n11 He replied, \"The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.\"\n\n12 \"Where is this man?\" they asked him.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.\n\nThe Pharisees Investigate the Healing\n\n13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 14 Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. 15 Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \"He put mud on my eyes,\" the man replied, \"and I washed, and now I see.\"\n\n16 Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\"\n\nBut others asked, \"How can a sinner perform such signs?\" So they were divided.\n\n17 Then they turned again to the blind man, \"What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\"\n\nThe man replied, \"He is a prophet.\"\n\n18 They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. 19 \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\"\n\n20 \"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind. 21 But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\" 22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. 23 That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\"\n\n24 A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God by telling the truth,\" they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\"\n\n25 He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\"\n\n26 Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"\n\n27 He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\"\n\n28 Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! 29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\"\n\n30 The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. 32 Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\"\n\n34 To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out.\n\nSpiritual Blindness\n\n35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"\n\n36 \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\"\n\n37 Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\"\n\n38 Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him.\n\n39 Jesus said,[a] \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\"\n\n40 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind too?\"\n\n41 Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.\n\nFootnotes\na. John 9",

And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 3 And Jehovah said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot [b]three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning [c]Ethiopia; 4 so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 6 And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria",

Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?\"\n\nBut Samson said to his father, \"Get her for me. She's the right one for me.\" 4 (His parents did not know that this was from the Lord, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)\n\n5 Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. 6 The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done. 7 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.\n\n8 Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey. 9 He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's carcass.\n\n10 Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men. 11 When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions.\n\n12 \"Let me tell you a riddle,\" Samson said to them. \"If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. 13 If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.\"\n\n\"Tell us your riddle,\" they said. \"Let's hear it.\"\n\n14 He replied,\n\n\"Out of the eater, something to eat;\n    out of the strong, something sweet.\"\n\nFor three days they could not give the answer.\n\n15 On the fourth[a] day, they said to Samson's wife, \"Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to steal our property?\"\n\n16 Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, \"You hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer.\"\n\n\"I haven't even explained it to my father or mother,\" he replied, \"so why should I explain it to you?\" 17 She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.\n\n18 Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him,\n\n\"What is sweeter than honey?\n    What is stronger than a lion?\"\n\nSamson said to them,\n\n\"If you had not plowed with my heifer,\n    you would not have solved my riddle.\"\n\n19 Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he returned to his father's home. 20 And Samson's wife was given to one of his companions who had attended him at the feast.\n\nFootnotes\na. Judges 14",

They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.\n\n4 Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\"\n\n5 \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied.\n\n\"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) 6 When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground.\n\n7 Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\"\n\n\"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they said.\n\n8 Jesus answered, \"I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\" 9 This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled",

The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. 2 The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. 3 When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, \"Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.\"\n\n4 So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\n\n5 When the ark of the Lord's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. 6 Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, \"What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?\"\n\nWhen they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, 7 the Philistines were afraid. \"A god has[a] come into the camp,\" they said. \"Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. 8 We're doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 9 Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!\"\n\n10 So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. 11 The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.\n\nDeath of Eli\n\n12 That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 13 When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.\n\n14 Eli heard the outcry and asked, \"What is the meaning of this uproar?\"\n\nThe man hurried over to Eli, 15 who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. 16 He told Eli, \"I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.\"\n\nEli asked, \"What happened, my son?\"\n\n17 The man who brought the news replied, \"Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\"\n\n18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led[b] Israel forty years.\n\n19 His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. 20 As she was dying, the women attending her said, \"Don't despair; you have given birth to a son.\" But she did not respond or pay any attention.\n\n21 She named the boy Ichabod,[c] saying, \"The Glory has departed from Israel\"--because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 22 She said, \"The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.\"\n\nFootnotes\na. 1 Samuel 4",

They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 4 But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. 5 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.\n\n6 The Lord's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.[a] 7 When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, \"The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.\" 8 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, \"What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?\"\n\nThey answered, \"Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.\" So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.\n\n9 But after they had moved it, the Lord's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.[b] 10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\n\nAs the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, \"They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.\" 11 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, \"Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it[c] will kill us and our people.\" For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it. 12 Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.\n\nFootnotes\na. 1 Samuel 5",

For a while he stayed in Gerar, 2 and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, \"She is my sister.\" Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.\n\n3 But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, \"You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.\"\n\n4 Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, \"Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? 5 Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.\"\n\n6 Then God said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 7 Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.\"\n\n8 Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. 9 Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, \"What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.\" 10 And Abimelek asked Abraham, \"What was your reason for doing this?\"\n\n11 Abraham replied, \"I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' 12 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. 13 And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me",

Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.\"\n\n5 The Hittites replied to Abraham, 6 \"Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.\"\n\n7 Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. 8 He said to them, \"If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 9 so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.\"\n\n10 Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. 11 \"No, my lord,\" he said. \"Listen to me; I give[b] you the field, and I give[c] you the cave that is in it. I give[d] it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.\"\n\n12 Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 13 and he said to Ephron in their hearing, \"Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.\"\n\n14 Ephron answered Abraham, 15 \"Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels[e] of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.\"\n\n16 Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites",

There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. 5 The name written on her forehead was a mystery",

As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. 3 Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.\"\n\n4 \"You have not cheated or oppressed us,\" they replied. \"You have not taken anything from anyone's hand.\"\n\n5 Samuel said to them, \"The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.\"\n\n\"He is witness,\" they said.\n\n6 Then Samuel said to the people, \"It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. 7 Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your ancestors.\n\n8 \"After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.\n\n9 \"But they forgot the Lord their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. 10 They cried out to the Lord and said, 'We have sinned; we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.' 11 Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal,[a] Barak,[b] Jephthah and Samuel,[c] and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety.\n\n12 \"But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us'--even though the Lord your God was your king. 13 Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the Lord has set a king over you. 14 If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God--good! 15 But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.\n\n16 \"Now then, stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes! 17 Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.\"\n\n18 Then Samuel called on the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel.\n\n19 The people all said to Samuel, \"Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.\"\n\n20 \"Do not be afraid,\" Samuel replied. \"You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. 21 Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. 22 For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own. 23 As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. 24 But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. 25 Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.\"\n\nFootnotes\na. 1 Samuel 12",

And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away. 4 When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.\"\n\n5 Then at the Lord's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites",

So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. 2 The man's name was Elimelek, his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.\n\n3 Now Elimelek, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 4 They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.\n\nNaomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem\n6 When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. 7 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.\n\n8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \"Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me. 9 May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\"\n\nThen she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud 10 and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\"\n\n11 But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 12 Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me--even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons-- 13 would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord's hand has turned against me!\"\n\n14 At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.\n\n15 \"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\"\n\n16 But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.\" 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.\n\n19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\"\n\n20 \"Don't call me Naomi,[b]\" she told them. \"Call me Mara,[c] because the Almighty[d] has made my life very bitter. 21 I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted[e] me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.\"\n\n22 So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.\n\nFootnotes\na.
