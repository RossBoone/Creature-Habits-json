    "Summarize2": "In Leviticus 14:33-53, God instructs Moses and Aaron on how to cleanse a house that has been affected by defiling molds. The owner of the house is to report the mold to the priest, who will inspect the house and determine the extent of the contamination. If the mold spreads, the contaminated stones are to be removed, and the walls are to be scraped and replastered. If the mold reappears, the house is to be torn down and removed from the town. Those who enter the closed-up house or sleep or eat in it are considered unclean and must wash their clothes. If the mold does not spread after the house has been plastered, it is pronounced clean. To purify the house, the priest is to take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop. One bird is killed over fresh water, and the live bird, along with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, is dipped into the blood and water mixture and used to sprinkle the house seven times. The live bird is then released outside the town, symbolizing atonement for the house and its cleansing.",
