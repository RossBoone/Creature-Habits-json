    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the symbol of cleansing and purification. In Psalm 51, the speaker asks God to wash away their iniquity and cleanse them from sin, using metaphors of washing with water and being made whiter than snow. This symbol of cleansing and purification develops throughout the Bible in various ways, such as in the ritual practices of washing and purification in the Old Testament, the concept of baptism in the New Testament, and the idea of spiritual cleansing from sin through the blood of Jesus Christ.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the ark. The ark represents God's protection and salvation for His chosen people. It is a symbol of deliverance from destruction and a means of preserving life. The ark in these verses foreshadows the future redemption and salvation of God's people, as seen in other biblical stories such as the rescue of Moses in the basket, and the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the idea of judgment and punishment for the ungodly. This theme can be seen in the examples mentioned, such as the judgment of angels, the flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the punishment of false teachers. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, emphasizing the consequences of unrighteousness and the importance of repentance and righteousness.",

    "Summarize3": "False teachers will arise among the people, introducing destructive teachings and exploiting others for their own gain. Just as God punished the angels, the ancient world, and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, He will also punish the unrighteous.

    "psychology1": "One theme from this text is the recognition and acknowledgement of personal wrongdoing or transgressions. This theme can be applied to findings in contemporary psychology research on guilt and remorse. Research has shown that individuals who take responsibility for their actions and express guilt or remorse are more likely to engage in moral repair and seek forgiveness, leading to positive psychological outcomes and growth (Wenzel, Okimoto, & Feather, 2008; Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007).",
    "psychology2": "Theme: Resilience and Adaptation\n\nContemporary psychology research has shown that humans have a natural capacity for resilience and adaptation in the face of challenging circumstances. Studies have found that individuals can bounce back from trauma, adversity, and even natural disasters, displaying remarkable psychological and emotional resilience. This ability to adapt and recover from difficult situations is key to maintaining mental well-being and overall psychological health (Bonanno, 2004; Masten & Narayan, 2012).",
    "psychology3": "Theme: Presence of False Teachers and Their Influence\n\nContemporary psychology research has found parallels with the presence and influence of false teachers described in 2 Peter 2:1-10. Studies on cognitive biases and susceptibility to misinformation demonstrate how people can be deceived by false information and teachings. Manipulative individuals may exploit these cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and availability heuristic, to spread destructive ideologies and gain followers. This emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and skepticism in evaluating information and recognizing false teachings. \n\nResearch source:\nPennycook, G., & Rand, D. G. (2019).
