This symbol develops throughout the Bible as it is mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:12, where it is emphasized as a distinguishing mark for God's people. In Matthew 9:20-21, a woman touches the tassel on Jesus' garment, symbolizing her faith and healing. Jesus also warns against religious leaders who enlarge their tassels as a sign of outward righteousness in Matthew 23:5.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is discipline. The passage highlights that God disciplines his children out of love and for their good, similar to how human fathers discipline their own children. This theme of discipline as a means of growth and producing righteousness can be seen in various instances throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Joseph, Moses, and the Israelites in the wilderness. In each case, hardships and trials were used as discipline to shape and refine individuals or the nation of Israel.",
