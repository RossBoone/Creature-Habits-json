    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is God's knowledge of and involvement in the individual's life. This symbol emphasizes God's omniscience and his role as the creator. This theme can be seen in other passages such as Jeremiah 1:5 and Isaiah 49:1-5, where God knows and has a plan for individuals even before their birth. The development of this symbol highlights God's intimate relationship with each person and his sovereignty over their lives.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the imagery of the potter and the clay. This symbol represents God's sovereignty and power over individuals and nations, emphasizing his ability to shape and mold them according to his will. This metaphor is found in other passages such as Isaiah 64:8 and Romans 9:21, further developing the idea of God as the ultimate creator and shaper of destinies.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the symbol of reconciliation and transformation. This symbol is developed throughout the Bible through stories of forgiveness, redemption, and the restoration of broken relationships. Examples include the story of Joseph and his brothers, the Prodigal Son, and Jesus' forgiveness of Peter after his denial. In Philemon, Paul uses this symbol to appeal for the reconciliation and transformation of Onesimus, urging Philemon to welcome him back as a brother rather than as a slave.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the symbol of the cross. In this passage, Jesus talks about carrying one's cross as a requirement for being a disciple. The symbol of the cross develops throughout the Bible as a representation of self-sacrifice, suffering, and ultimate redemption. It is seen in the crucifixion of Jesus and is often used metaphorically to symbolize the cost and commitment of following him.",
    "Summarize1": "Psalm 139:1-6, 13-18 is a psalm written by David, praising God for his knowledge and creation of humanity. It highlights God's infinite understanding and care for individuals. Psalm 1 contrasts the blessings of those who follow God's ways with the destruction that awaits the wicked.",
    "Summarize2": "Jeremiah 18:1-11 portrays God as the potter and Israel as the clay, illustrating how God can shape and mold nations. Deuteronomy 30:15-20 presents a choice between life and prosperity or death and destruction based on obedience to God's commands.",
    "Summarize3": "In this letter, Paul expresses gratitude for Philemon's love and faith and asks for forgiveness and acceptance of his runaway slave, Onesimus. Paul hopes that their partnership in the faith will deepen and that Philemon will welcome Onesimus as a brother. Paul promises to repay any debt owed by Onesimus and expresses confidence in Philemon's obedience.",
    "Summarize4": "Jesus emphasizes the cost of discipleship, stating that to follow him, one must be willing to prioritize him above all else, including family and even one's own life. Additionally, he compares the commitment to building a tower or going to war, highlighting the importance of counting the cost and being fully dedicated.",
    "Behindinsights1": "One possible insight from external research is that Psalm 139 is often seen as a psalm that speaks to the intimate relationship between God and the individual. The passage highlights God's omniscience and awareness of every aspect of a person's life, including their thoughts, actions, and even their formation in the womb. This psalm is also often interpreted as a reflection on the uniqueness and inherent value of every human life.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "",
    "Behind insights 4": "One interesting insight about this passage is that Jesus is not literally advocating for His disciples to hate their family members. The use of the word \"hate\" here is a figure of speech to emphasize the importance of one's commitment and dedication to following Jesus. It conveys the idea that disciples should love Jesus and prioritize their relationship with Him above all else, including their closest relationships.",
    "SocioSummary1": "The socio-historical context of the passages is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer some details based on authorship attribution and general historical context. Psalm 139, attributed to David in the 10th century BCE, reflects the challenges faced by Israel as a small kingdom surrounded by larger and more powerful nations. Psalm 1 emphasizes the importance of following God's law and contrasts the outcomes of the righteous and the wicked. These themes can be understood within the broader context of the geopolitical challenges Israel faced during its history.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passages were written in ancient Israel during a time of political instability and moral decline. The people had turned away from worshiping the Lord and engaged in idolatry. The prophet Jeremiah was sent by God to warn them of the consequences and call for repentance. The passages stress the importance of obedience to God's laws and discuss the consequences of disobedience and the opportunity for redemption. They highlight the impending judgment and the chance for salvation.",
    "SocioSummary3": "During the first century AD, the Roman Empire was dominant in the surrounding regions including Asia Minor. Slavery was widely accepted and slaves had limited rights. The passage in Philemon relates to a runaway slave named Onesimus and the apostle Paul's plea to his owner, Philemon, to forgive and receive him as a brother in Christ. Christianity was spreading, emphasizing equality and love, despite the social hierarchies of Roman society. The passage reflects this belief by urging Philemon to welcome Onesimus as a brother, rather than a slave.",
    "SocioSummary4": "The passage in Luke 14:25-33 from the first century, during Jesus' ministry, was written amidst Roman dominance and occupation in the region. The Jewish people were living under Roman rule and were burdened by heavy taxation, leading to tension and occasional uprisings. Jesus' teachings of the kingdom of God and call for discipleship offered hope to those seeking deliverance from Roman oppression. The passage emphasizes the commitment and sacrifices required to be a disciple in a society facing significant challenges under Roman rule.",
    "Scene1": "The scene from the movie \"The Truman Show\" where Truman Burbank discovers that his entire life has been a reality TV show and that every aspect of his life has been carefully monitored and controlled is similar to the themes expressed in Psalm 139:1-6, 13-18. Truman realizes that he has been watched and known his whole life, just as the psalmist acknowledges that God knows and sees everything about them.",

    "Scene2": "The scene from the movie \"Ghost\" where Oda Mae tells Molly about Sam's message from beyond the grave. Sam, as a ghost, communicates with Oda Mae, a medium, who then relays his message to Molly. In both cases, there is a messenger delivering a message from a higher power to someone who needs to make a crucial decision that will determine their fate.",

    "Scene3": "The scene from the movie \"Captain America: Civil War\" where Captain America and Iron Man are discussing the Sokovia Accords and the fate of Bucky Barnes (The Winter Soldier) is similar to this passage. Captain America, like Paul, pleads for Bucky's redemption and reconciliation rather than punishment, highlighting the power of love and forgiveness. Just as Paul appeals to Philemon to welcome Onesimus as a dear brother, Captain America argues for Bucky's worth and the possibility of redemption.",

    "emily4": "In crowds they followed, seeking light,\nWith hearts so hopeful, eyes so bright.\nBut Jesus spoke, his words severe,\nTo shake their souls, to bring them fear.\n\n\"For those who come, but still hold close,\nTheir loved ones dear, their life's repose,\nCannot be mine, cannot withstand,\nThe cost of discipleship, it demands.\"\n\nHe urged them all, to take their cross,\nTo bear the weight, to feel the loss.\nFor in this path, true disciples find,\nThe surrender of self, heart, and mind.\n\nLike builders wise, who count the price,\nOf towers grand, of sacrifice,\nBefore they start, before they build,\nTo know if strength and will are filled.\n\nA king, he ponders, battle's might,\nTo vanquish foes, to win the fight.\nBut if outnumbered, he seeks peace,\nFor wisdom knows, when wars must cease.\n\nIn same accord, disciples find,\nThey must forsake, things left behind.\nFor to embrace, the Savior's call,\nIs to surrender, give up all.\n\nOh, poignant words, that pierce the soul,\nTo challenge us, to make us whole.\nFor in this world, where comfort thrives,\nWe're called to lay down our selfish lives.\n\nTo love like never loved before,\nTo serve and give, to truly pour,\nOur all to Christ, our utmost best,\nFor there lies true discipleship's test.\n\nSo let us ponder, count the cost,\nOf being disciples, no matter the frost.\nThough it may seem a heavy price,\nIn surrender, we find paradise.",

    "psychology1": "Theme: Divine Knowledge and Intimacy\n\nContemporary psychology research supports the theme of divine knowledge and intimacy found in Psalm 139:1-6, 13-18. For example, studies on attachment theory show that secure attachments are formed when individuals feel deeply known and understood by others. Additionally, research on self-awareness and mindfulness demonstrates the benefits of recognizing and accepting one's thoughts and emotions. These findings highlight the importance of feeling seen and known by both a higher power and others for well-being and flourishing.",
    "psychology2": "One theme from this text is the concept of choice and consequences. The text emphasizes that individuals have the power to choose between good and evil, obedience and disobedience, and that their choices have real-life implications. This theme can be seen in contemporary psychology research on decision-making and the impact of choices on well-being and behavior (Koriat, 2012; Gal & Rucker, 2018).",
    "psychology3": "One theme from this text is the idea of forgiveness and reconciliation. In contemporary psychology research, forgiveness is a topic of interest as it has been found to have numerous mental health benefits. Studies show that forgiveness is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and higher levels of well-being and relationship satisfaction. It is also linked to better physical health outcomes. Forgiveness and reconciliation can play a crucial role in promoting psychological well-being and interpersonal harmony. (Source: Toussaint, L. L., & Webb, J. R. (2005). Theoretical and empirical connections between forgiveness, mental health, and well-being. In E. L. Worthington Jr. (Ed.), Handbook of forgiveness (pp. 349-362). Routledge.)",
    "psychology4": "Theme: The Cost of Commitment\n\nIn contemporary psychology research, the theme of the cost of commitment can be seen in studies on the concept of sacrifice. For example, research by Lambert et al. (2018) found that individuals who were willing to make sacrifices for their romantic partners exhibited higher relationship satisfaction and commitment. This suggests that, like in the biblical passage, a willingness to give up certain things can lead to stronger personal connections and commitment in various domains of life.",
    "biology1": "Scientific Finding: The significance of the microbiome in human health and wellness.\n\nTheme: \"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.\"\n\nExplanation: This theme from Psalm 139 emphasizes the wonder of human creation and the intricate processes involved. Similarly, scientific research has discovered the vital role of the microbiome, the collection of microorganisms in and on our bodies, in shaping our overall health. Just as God created and intricately designed humans, scientists have found that the development and composition of the microbiome greatly influence our immune system, digestion, metabolism, and mental well-being.\n\nResearch sources:\n1.

    "biology3": "One theme in this text is forgiveness and reconciliation. This can be applied to the scientific finding that social isolation and loneliness have negative effects on health and well-being, while social support and connectedness have positive effects on health outcomes. Research has shown that individuals with strong social connections and a support system are more likely to experience better physical and mental health compared to those who are socially isolated (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; House et al., 1988). This emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation in fostering social connections and maintaining a healthy social support system.\n\nReferences:\nHolt-Lunstad, J., Smith, T.

    "biology4": "Theme: The cost of commitment and sacrifice\n\nScientific finding: In the field of evolutionary biology, the theory of kin selection explains the cost of altruistic behavior in terms of genetic relatedness. Individuals are more likely to help close relatives, even at a personal cost, because it increases the chances of their genes being passed on. This is known as inclusive fitness. In certain social insect colonies, such as ants or bees, workers may sacrifice their own reproductive potential and even risk their lives in defense of the colony due to the high genetic relatedness among members.\n\nSource: Hamilton, W.
