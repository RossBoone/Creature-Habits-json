    "Common Themes And Application": "- The theme of praising and worshiping God is present in Psalm 98.\n- The theme of God's presence and glory is highlighted in Ezekiel 10:1-19.\n- The theme of the second coming of Jesus and the importance of being ready is emphasized in Luke 17:20-37.\n- The life application from these passages is to continually praise and worship God, acknowledge His presence and glory in our lives, and be prepared for the return of Jesus.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the theme of salvation. It is mentioned in verse 1 when it says that God's right hand and holy arm have worked salvation, and again in verse 2 when it says that God has made his salvation known. This theme of salvation continues to develop throughout the Bible as it is mentioned in various contexts and fulfilled through Jesus Christ.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the presence of God's glory. It is depicted as a cloud and radiance that fills the temple, represented by the cherubim and the wheels. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as the glory of God is seen in various manifestations, such as the pillar of cloud and fire in the exodus from Egypt, the glory cloud in the Tabernacle, and the transfiguration of Jesus.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the coming of the Son of Man. In these verses, Jesus speaks about how people will long to see the Son of Man but won't find him easily. He also compares the coming of the Son of Man to the days of Noah and Lot, emphasizing the suddenness and unexpectedness of his arrival. This symbol of the coming of the Son of Man develops throughout the Bible, particularly in prophecies about the Messiah and Jesus' teachings about his eventual return.",

    "Summarize1": "Psalm 98 is a song of praise to the Lord for His salvation and righteousness. It calls for all the earth to shout for joy and make music to worship God, for He will come to judge the world with righteousness and equity.",
    "Summarize2": "In Ezekiel 10, the prophet sees a vision of God's glory departing from the temple. The cherubim and wheels are described in detail, and the glory of the Lord moves to the threshold of the temple, then to the entrance of the east gate of the Lord's house.",
    "Summarize3": "In Luke 17:20-37, Jesus responds to the Pharisees' question about when the kingdom of God will come. He explains that the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed externally, but rather it is within the believers. Jesus warns his disciples not to be misled by false claims of his return, emphasizing that when he does come, it will be sudden and like a flash of lightning. He compares his return to the days of Noah and Lot, stating that people were carrying on with their normal activities until sudden destruction came upon them. Jesus advises his followers to not be attached to their possessions and to remember Lot's wife, who turned back and was destroyed. He also states that when he returns, there will be a separation between those taken and those left behind. When asked where these events will occur, Jesus responds metaphorically, saying that wherever there is destruction and judgment, vultures will gather.",

    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it emphasizes the universal nature of God's salvation. It mentions that God has revealed his righteousness to the nations and that all the ends of the earth have seen his salvation. This suggests that God's salvation is not limited to a specific group or region, but is available to all people.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is the comparison made by Jesus between the days of Noah and the days of the Son of Man. He parallels the obliviousness and indulgence of people in Noah's time, who were destroyed by the flood, with the state of the world when the Son of Man is revealed. It highlights the need for vigilance and readiness for the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God.",

    "SocioSummary1": "The psalm mentioned in the passage is attributed to David and is believed to have been written during the 10th century BCE, when the Israelites were establishing themselves as a nation in Canaan under King David's reign. The passage reflects a sense of triumph and celebration, praising God for salvation and righteousness. It suggests the Israelites may have been facing challenges or threats during this time, but does not provide specific socio-historical details of the surrounding geographies.",
    "SocioSummary2": "Ezekiel 10:1-19 was written during the Babylonian exile, when the Israelites were taken captive for their disobedience. It describes a vision of God's glory leaving the temple in Jerusalem, symbolizing the removal of divine protection and the abandonment of the temple. This reflects the desolation and destruction experienced by the Israelites during their exile.",
    "SocioSummary3": "During the events described in this passage, the region of Judea and Galilee was under Roman rule. The Jewish people, including the Pharisees, were living under Roman authority and subject to Roman laws and taxes. The region had a diverse religious landscape, with Judaism being the dominant faith but other religious groups and sects also present. There were also Greco-Roman influences and cultural norms in the area. Roman dominance and religious diversity characterized the socio-historical situation.",

Similarly, in Ezekiel 10, the glory of the Lord fills the temple, and the cherubim and wheels move in alignment with God's presence.",

Bacterial motility is enabled by specialized appendages called flagella, which rotate and propel the bacteria through their surroundings.
