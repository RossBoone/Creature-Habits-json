    "Symbols1Summarize": "The symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the \"word\" or \"law\" of God. The psalmist recognizes the importance of God's commands, seeking understanding and wisdom from them. The psalmist's affliction serves as a way to learn and obey God's word. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as God's word is seen as the source of guidance, wisdom, and salvation for His people.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the act of humbling oneself before the Lord. This symbol represents repentance and acknowledging one's dependence on God. Examples of how it develops throughout the Bible include the story of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) who humbles himself before his father and the story of King Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 4) who is humbled by God and then repents.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is blood. In the Old Testament, the high priest carried the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering. In the New Testament, Jesus suffered outside the city gate and made people holy through his own blood. The blood symbolizes sacrifice and atonement for sins, illustrating the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.",

    "Summarize1": "In this psalm, the author expresses their desire for God to do good to them according to His word. They ask for knowledge and good judgment, acknowledging their trust in God's commands. The author recognizes that before they were afflicted, they went astray, but now they obey God's word. They praise God for His goodness and ask Him to teach them His decrees. Despite being lied about by the arrogant, the author remains devoted to obeying God's precepts with all their heart. While the hearts of the arrogant are callous, the author finds delight in God's law. They acknowledge that it was good for them to be afflicted so that they could learn God's decrees. The law from God's mouth is more precious to the author than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.",
    "Summarize2": "After Rehoboam became strong as king, he and all of Israel abandoned the law of the Lord. As a result, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem. He captured the fortified cities of Judah and took away the treasures of the temple and the royal palace. However, when the prophet Shemaiah declared that they had abandoned the Lord, the leaders and the king humbled themselves and acknowledged God's justice. Seeing their humility, the Lord decided not to destroy them completely, but they would become subject to Shishak. Rehoboam replaced the gold shields with bronze ones and continued to worship in the temple. Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the Lord's anger turned away, and there was still some good in Judah.",
    "Summarize3": "In Hebrews 13:7-21, the author encourages the readers to remember and imitate their leaders' faith. They are advised to stay away from strange teachings and instead be strengthened by grace. The author emphasizes that Jesus is unchanging and that they have an altar that those who serve at the tabernacle do not have access to. Jesus suffered outside the city gate to make people holy through his blood, and so they are urged to go to him outside the camp and bear the disgrace he bore. The readers are reminded to continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God and to do good and share with others. They are told to have confidence in their leaders and submit to their authority. The readers are asked to pray for the author and to pray for his restoration. The passage concludes with a benediction and final greetings. The readers are assured that God, through the blood of Jesus, will equip them with everything needed to do His will and work in them what is pleasing to Him. The passage ends with a declaration of glory to Jesus Christ.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 119 was likely written during the 5th century BCE in post-exilic Israel. The Jewish people had returned to Jerusalem after being exiled to Babylon and were rebuilding their community. The psalm reflects the writer's religious devotion and commitment, seeking God's guidance and praising the importance of following God's commands. It highlights the contrast between the writer's dedication to God and the wickedness of their adversaries. The psalmist acknowledges that affliction is important for spiritual development and recognizes the value of God's teachings over material wealth.",
    "SocioSummary2": "During the reign of King Rehoboam in the kingdom of Judah, they turned away from the law of the Lord, leading to God abandoning them. As a result, the king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and conquered the fortified cities of Judah. However, when the leaders and the king repented and humbled themselves before God, he showed them mercy and did not completely destroy them.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The authorship and dating of Hebrews is uncertain, but it seems to address Jewish Christians facing pressure to return to Judaism. The passage emphasizes the superiority of Christ over the Old Testament religious system and urges readers to remain steadfast in their faith. The author highlights Jesus' sacrificial work and compares it to the rituals of the high priest. The socio-historical situation at the time of writing was one of persecution and pressure to abandon Christianity. The passage seeks to strengthen and encourage readers to remain committed to Christ.",
