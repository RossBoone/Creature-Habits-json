    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the Lord, who is portrayed as the all-powerful and faithful God. Throughout the Bible, the Lord develops as a symbol of hope, deliverance, and provision for the oppressed, hungry, blind, and those in need. The Lord is also seen as a righteous judge who frustrates the ways of the wicked and reigns forever.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. This theme develops throughout the Bible, highlighting the consequences and outcomes for those who follow God's ways versus those who reject them. The righteous are depicted as being blessed, kept safe, and enjoying favor and prosperity. In contrast, the wicked are shown to be deluded, facing trouble, destruction, and ultimately perishing. This symbol of the righteous versus the wicked emphasizes the importance of living a righteous and faithful life.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the concept of humility. Jesus uses a child as a symbol of humility and teaches that the greatest in his kingdom are those who are least. This theme of humility is developed throughout the Bible, with passages such as Proverbs 11:2, Matthew 23:12, and 1 Peter 5:5 emphasizing the importance of humility in the eyes of God.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "Please provide message",
    "Summarize1": "The psalmist praises the Lord and expresses trust in God. He warns against putting trust in humans. The Lord is praised for his faithfulness, care for the oppressed, and provision for the needy. God reigns forever.",
    "Summarize2": "The passage from Proverbs 28:11-28 highlights various themes such as the delusion of the rich, the triumph of the righteous, the consequences of concealing sins, the blessing of trembling before God, the danger of wicked rulers, the importance of integrity, the rewards of hard work, the dangers of greed, the power of rebuke, the importance of generosity, and the ultimate triumph of the righteous.",
    "Summarize3": "In this passage, Jesus predicts his own death for the second time, but his disciples fail to understand. They later argue about who is the greatest among them, and Jesus teaches them that humility is what makes someone truly great.",

    "Behindinsights1": "Without external research, it is not apparent that this psalm is part of a collection of five psalms known as \"Hallelujah Psalms\" (Psalm 146-150). These psalms are believed to be a concluding doxology to the book of Psalms and are often recited or sung during Jewish worship services.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "An interesting insight about this passage is that it reveals the disciples' lack of understanding and their preoccupation with their own status and greatness. This highlights their human frailty and their need for growth and humility in their faith journey. Additionally, by using a child as an example, Jesus teaches the disciples the importance of humility and service.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 146 was likely composed during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE. It reflects the despair and longing for the restoration of the Jewish nation and their worship. The Psalm also recognizes the limitations of earthly rulers and emphasizes the need to trust in God.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The text describes a society divided between the rich and the poor, with the rich being arrogant and the poor being discerning. It explores the consequences of the wicked gaining power, which leads to fear and hiding. The importance of honesty and confession is emphasized as a means of finding mercy, and humility and reverence towards God are also highlighted.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The events in this passage take place during a time of Roman rule in Judea, where the Jewish population had limited autonomy. The religious climate was predominantly Jewish, with tension between Jewish leaders and Roman authorities. Society was hierarchical, with Roman elites at the top and ordinary Jewish people at lower social statuses. Children held low status in society. Jesus challenges traditional social hierarchies and teaches about humility and service. The disciples struggle to understand Jesus' message and the concept of his death, as it contradicts their Messianic expectations.",

    "Scene2": "A scene from the movie \"The Dark Knight\" is similar to this passage. In the movie, when the villainous Joker rises to power, people go into hiding out of fear. Similarly, in Proverbs 28:12, it states that when the wicked rise to power, people also go into hiding. Both portray the same idea of people seeking refuge and hiding when faced with a menacing and wicked ruler.",

The argument among the disciples about who is the greatest also mirrors the tension and competitiveness among Cobb's team members.",
