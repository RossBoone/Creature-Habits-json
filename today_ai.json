    "SocioSummary3": "During the time of writing of 2 Peter, Christians faced challenges and uncertainties in the Roman Empire, a polytheistic society that conflicted with their monotheistic beliefs.

There were also internal issues within the Christian community, with false teachings, distortions of Scripture, and moral laxity leading to divisions. The author of 2 Peter encourages believers to remain faithful, be vigilant against false teachings, and eagerly await God's salvation.",
