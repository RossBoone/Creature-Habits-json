In Esther, the signet ring represents the king's authority and power, as it is used to seal official documents. It is given to Haman, enabling him to issue an edict to destroy the Jews. This symbol of authority and power develops throughout the Bible, representing the authority of kings and rulers, and later symbolizing God's authority and power over creation.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the cross. In this passage, it is mentioned that Jesus was put to death by being nailed to the cross (verse 23). The cross symbolizes Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection.
