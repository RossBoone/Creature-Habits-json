    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is God's law or word. The psalmist expresses their love for God's law and how it brings wisdom, insight, understanding, and guidance. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as God's law is seen as a source of life, a path to righteousness, and a means of knowing and communing with God.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is wisdom. In Proverbs 9, Wisdom is personified as a wise woman who invites people to her house to partake in her food and drink. This symbol of wisdom develops throughout the Bible, with numerous references to seeking wisdom, valuing wisdom, and the benefits of having wisdom. Wisdom is seen as a virtue and a path to a flourishing life.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the concept of atonement or the atoning sacrifice. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, starting with the sacrificial system in the Old Testament where animals were offered as atonement for sins.

    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "Based on external research, one interesting insight about this passage is that the concept of Jesus as the advocate with the Father is also mentioned in the book of Hebrews (Hebrews 7:25).

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 119:97-104 expresses a love for God's law and a commitment to obedience in the midst of socio-historical challenges faced by the Israelites. These challenges included political instability, foreign invasions, and idolatry. The author emphasizes the importance of meditating on God's statutes, gaining wisdom, and avoiding evil paths as a response to these difficulties. The passage is attributed to King David and is believed to have been written around the 6th century BCE.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage explores the themes of wisdom and folly within a socio-political context that values knowledge and understanding. The fear of the Lord is emphasized, hinting at a religious or spiritual aspect of the culture. The mention of a city and invitations made from the highest point suggest an urbanized and social environment. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific socio-political context of the passage.",
    "SocioSummary3": "1 John was written during the time of the Roman Empire, where Christianity was growing as a marginalized and persecuted religious movement. The recipients of the letter likely resided in the region of Asia Minor. The author sought to address the concerns of the community in this context, emphasizing the importance of love, obedience to God's commands, and the atoning sacrifice of Jesus. The letter also addressed false teachings and urged the recipients to discern between truth and falsehood in the face of competing religious and philosophical influences.",
