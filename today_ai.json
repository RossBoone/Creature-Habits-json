    "Common Themes And Application": "- The theme of trust in God's promises is common in all the passages.\n- The life application of relying on God's guidance and not being afraid is evident in Isaiah 7:10-16.\n- The theme of restoration and God's provision is present in Psalm 80:1-7,17-19.\n- Romans 1:1-7 emphasizes the theme of the gospel being God's power for salvation.\n- The life application of obedience and faithfulness to God's calling is highlighted in Matthew 1:18-25.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the \"face\" or \"countenance\" of God. It represents God's favor, blessing, and salvation. Examples of this symbol developing throughout the Bible include when Moses saw God's face and received the Ten Commandments, and when Jesus, the ultimate manifestation of God's face, came to bring salvation to humanity. In these verses, the psalmist repeatedly asks for God's face to shine upon them, indicating their desire for God's presence and blessing.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the concept of a \"sign.\" In this passage, Ahaz is asked to request a sign from God, but he refuses. However, Isaiah prophesies that a sign will still be given: a virgin will conceive and give birth to a son named Immanuel. This theme of signs as divine confirmations and prophecies continues throughout the Bible, representing God's presence and intervention in human affairs. For example, in Exodus, God gives various signs to Moses to perform before Pharaoh to prove His power and authority. In the New Testament, Jesus performs many signs and miracles to authenticate His identity as the Messiah.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses, and throughout the Bible in general, is the concept of \"grace.\" It is mentioned in verse 5 as the means through which the Gentiles received apostleship and the call to obedience. The development of this symbol can be seen in various instances, such as Abraham receiving grace from God despite his shortcomings, and the ultimate expression of grace in the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for the forgiveness of sins.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the name Jesus, which means \"the Lord saves.\" This symbol develops throughout the Bible as Jesus fulfills the prophecy of being the Savior who will save his people from their sins. The name Jesus represents salvation and redemption, and is central to the Christian faith.",
    "Summarize1": "Psalm 80 is a prayer to God, asking for restoration and salvation. The psalmist expresses their frustration with God's anger and asks for God's face to shine upon them. They request for God to revive them and turn their hearts towards Him.",
    "Summarize2": "Ahaz was hesitant to ask God for a sign, but Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son named Immanuel. Before the son reaches maturity, the land of two feared kings will be destroyed.",
    "Summarize3": "In Romans 1:1-7, Paul introduces himself as a servant and apostle of Christ. He mentions that the gospel was promised through the prophets and is centered around Jesus Christ, who, through his resurrection, was declared to be the Son of God. Paul emphasizes that through Jesus, grace and apostleship have been received to call all Gentiles to faith and obedience. He addresses this letter to the loved and holy people in Rome, extending grace and peace from God and Jesus Christ.",
    "Summarize4": "Joseph learns that Mary is pregnant through the Holy Spirit and wants to divorce her quietly, but an angel appears in a dream and tells him to take Mary as his wife because the child is from God. Joseph obeys and names the child Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy that the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son called Immanuel, meaning \"God with us.\"",
    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight from external research is that this psalm is often interpreted as a plea for God to restore and revive the nation of Israel. It is believed to have been written during a time of national distress, possibly after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by Assyria. The psalmist expresses longing for God's favor and intervention, so that the people may be saved and their enemies silenced.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it emphasizes the universality of the Gospel.

    "SocioSummary1": "The socio-historical situation surrounding the writing of Psalm 80 is not explicitly mentioned in the passage itself. It is likely that the Psalm was written during the period of the divided kingdom of Israel, after the death of King Solomon. This division occurred around the 10th century BCE, with Israel in the north and Judah in the south. The mention of being an object of derision and enemy mockery suggests a period of distress, possibly during a time of captivity or foreign oppression. Without specific details, it is difficult to determine the exact situation or events that led to the writing of this psalm.",
    "SocioSummary2": "In this passage, the prophet Isaiah appears before King Ahaz of Judah, who is facing a military threat. Isaiah reassures Ahaz that he will receive a sign from God - the birth of a child to a virgin who will be named Immanuel. This prophecy is meant to give Ahaz confidence that God is with him and that he will overcome his enemies.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The socio-historical context of the writing of Romans in the first century AD was characterized by the Roman Empire's vast territory, strong central government, and Hellenistic influence in the east. Tensions between the Jewish population and Roman authorities were high in Palestine, leading to the Jewish rebellion and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Various philosophical and religious movements, such as Stoicism and mystery cults, also shaped the social and intellectual climate of the region. Overall, the context was one of diversity and tension within the Roman Empire.",
    "SocioSummary4": "The passage takes place during the Roman Empire's rule over Palestine, governed by Herod the Great. The Jewish population, including Joseph and Mary, lived under Roman occupation and adhered to Jewish religious and cultural traditions. Joseph, a faithful and righteous man, considered divorcing Mary quietly when he learned she was pregnant to protect her from public disgrace. The passage also reflects the Jewish anticipation of a Messiah, and the broader historical context includes the Roman Empire's dominance and Herod's reign marked by political intrigue and cruelty.",

    "psychology1": "The theme of lament and petition for restoration can be seen in contemporary psychology research on resilience and recovery from traumatic experiences. Studies have found that expressing feelings of pain and distress through verbal or written expression can contribute to psychological healing and restoration. This process of acknowledging and processing negative emotions can lead to a sense of recovery and a renewed ability to function and thrive. (Sources: Pennebaker, J. W. (1997). Writing about emotional experiences as a therapeutic process. Psychological Science, 8(3), 162-166; Tedeschi, R. G., & Calhoun, L. G. (2004).

    "psychology2": "Theme: Trusting in divine signs\n\nContemporary psychology research has explored the concept of trust, particularly in relation to the perception of divine signs or intervention. Studies have found that individuals who have a higher inclination to trust in the divine are more likely to perceive and attribute meaning to signs or coincidences in their lives. This trust in divine signs can have positive psychological effects, such as increased hope and coping mechanisms during challenging times (e.g., research by Poloma & Gallup, 1991; Spilka et al., 1989).",
    "psychology3": "One theme from this text is the belief in a divine calling or purpose for individuals. This theme can be related to findings in contemporary psychology research on the sense of purpose and meaning in life. Studies have shown that having a sense of purpose is associated with various positive outcomes such as improved mental and physical health, increased well-being, and better resilience in the face of challenges (e.g., Hill et al., 2019; Steger et al., 2009).",
    "psychology4": "Theme: Acceptance and Faith in the Face of Unusual Circumstances\n\nContemporary psychology research has found that acceptance and faith in the face of unusual circumstances can lead to better mental health outcomes. Studies have shown that individuals who are able to accept and adapt to challenging situations, and who maintain a sense of faith or belief in something greater, experience lower levels of anxiety and depression. For example, a study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology found that individuals who embraced acceptance and placed their faith in a higher power showed greater psychological well-being and resilience in the face of adversity (Smith et al., 2019).",
