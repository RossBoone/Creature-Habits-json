    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the image of the king. This symbol represents justice, righteousness, protection of the afflicted, and bringing prosperity to the people. In the Old Testament, this symbol develops with the establishment of Davidic monarchy and the promise of a future messianic king. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of this symbol as the promised King and Messiah.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the \"Branch\" from the stump of Jesse. This symbol represents the promised Messiah who will come from the line of Jesse, the father of King David. Throughout the Bible, the symbol of the Branch develops as a representation of the coming Savior, Jesus Christ, who brings righteousness, justice, and peace to the world. This concept is further expanded in other prophecies, such as in Jeremiah 23:5-6 and Zechariah 6:12-13, where the Branch is explicitly identified as the Messiah.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is \"hope.\" Throughout the Bible, hope is mentioned as a source of endurance and encouragement (v. 4), a gift from God (v. 5), something that Gentiles can have through Christ (v. 9-12), and a blessing from the God of hope (v. 13). Hope is a recurring theme that offers assurance and confidence in God's promises.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the idea of repentance. John the Baptist preaches repentance and baptism as a way to prepare for the coming of the Messiah. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as other prophets and figures like Jesus continue to call for repentance and changing one's ways to align with God's will. It signifies a turning away from sin and towards righteousness.",

This person will separate the wheat from the chaff and bring judgment.",
