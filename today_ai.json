    "Common Themes And Application": "- The theme of worshiping and praising God is present in Psalm 98 and is encouraged as a life application.\n- The theme of seeking guidance from supernatural forces and the consequences of disobedience are seen in 1 Samuel 28:3-19, cautioning against engaging in forbidden practices.\n- The theme of God's wrath against ungodliness and the consequences of suppressing the truth about Him are addressed in Romans 1:18-25, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and honoring God in our lives.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the theme of salvation. It is mentioned in verse 1 when it says that God's right hand and holy arm have worked salvation, and again in verse 2 when it says that God has made his salvation known. This theme of salvation continues to develop throughout the Bible as it is mentioned in various contexts and fulfilled through Jesus Christ.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the concept of consulting spirits or the dead. This concept of seeking guidance or communication from the spiritual realm is seen in various occasions in the Bible, such as when Saul consults the medium at Endor to bring up Samuel from the dead. These instances consistently portray the human desire for supernatural guidance and the consequences of seeking answers from sources outside of God.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the idea of worshiping created things instead of the Creator. This theme develops throughout the Bible as it highlights the sinful nature of humanity and the consequences of idolatry. Examples include the Israelites worshiping the golden calf (Exodus 32), the rise and fall of various idolatrous nations in the Old Testament, and the warning against idolatry in the New Testament (1 John 5:21).",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "Please provide message",
    "Summarize1": "Psalm 98 is a song of praise to the Lord for His salvation and righteousness. It calls for all the earth to shout for joy and make music to worship God, for He will come to judge the world with righteousness and equity.",
    "Summarize2": "In 1 Samuel 28:3-19, Saul, the king of Israel, seeks out a medium in Endor to consult the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel. Samuel tells Saul that God has departed from him and that he and his sons will be defeated by the Philistines.",
    "Summarize3": "In Romans 1:18-25, it is stated that God's wrath is being revealed against the godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth. Despite knowing God, they do not glorify Him and instead worship false idols. As a result, God allows them to indulge in their sinful desires and they exchange the truth of God for lies.",
    "Summarize4": "",
    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it emphasizes the universal nature of God's salvation. It mentions that God has revealed his righteousness to the nations and that all the ends of the earth have seen his salvation. This suggests that God's salvation is not limited to a specific group or region, but is available to all people.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight from external research is that this passage reflects Paul's criticism of idolatry in the Roman Empire. At the time, the Roman Empire was filled with various pagan gods and idols, and Paul argues that people have exchanged the worship of the true God for worship of these created images. This context sheds light on Paul's strong words against idolatry in this passage.",

    "SocioSummary1": "The psalm mentioned in the passage is attributed to David and is believed to have been written during the 10th century BCE, when the Israelites were establishing themselves as a nation in Canaan under King David's reign. The passage reflects a sense of triumph and celebration, praising God for salvation and righteousness. It suggests the Israelites may have been facing challenges or threats during this time, but does not provide specific socio-historical details of the surrounding geographies.",
    "SocioSummary2": "In this passage, set during the reign of King Saul in ancient Israel, Saul is facing a crisis as the Philistine army prepares to fight against him. Desperate for guidance from God, Saul attempts various methods of divination but receives no response. Despite previously banning mediums and spiritists from the land, Saul disguises himself and seeks the help of a medium in Endor to summon the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel. This context emphasizes Saul's vulnerable position as king and his moral failing in going against God's commands, which ultimately leads to his downfall.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The Apostle Paul wrote the book of Romans during a time when the Roman Empire was dominant. The empire had political power, influenced by Greek and Hellenistic traditions, and promoted Roman culture and language. Religiously, the empire had a polytheistic belief system but allowed the practice of local religions within limits. In Romans 1:18-25, Paul highlights the moral depravity and idolatry of humanity, contrasting it with God's truth. This passage reflects Paul's understanding of the socio-historical context and the need for moral guidance and salvation in a world influenced by Roman dominance and pagan worship.",

    "Snoop2": "Once upon a time, in the land of Israel,\nSamuel was mourned and laid to rest, oh so well.\nSaul, the king, had banished all the mediums and mystics,\nBut now he needed answers, his heart full of tricks.\n\nThe Philistines gathered, setting camp at Shunem,\nWhile Saul and his army pitched their tents in Gilboa, son.\nWhen Saul caught sight of those fearsome foes,\nFear took hold, his heart in throes.\n\nHe sought guidance from the Lord, oh so high,\nThrough dreams, prophets, or Urim, he did try.\nBut no answer came, no guidance was given,\nHis fears and worries had his soul driven.\n\nThen Saul told his men, \"Seek a medium in this plight,\nFind me a woman who can commune with the spirits, right?\"\nThey said, \"There's one in Endor, she knows the way,\nBut Saul, you've banned her kind, what do you say?\"\n\nBut Saul swore an oath to this mystic lady,\n\"No harm shall come to you, my dear, so don't be shady.\"\nSo Saul disguised himself, like a whisper in the night,\nWith two men, he ventured towards the woman's light.\n\nHe said, \"Summon a spirit for me, I have a name,\nBring forth Samuel from the eternal flame.\"\nThe woman, afraid, exclaimed, \"Saul, you have deceived!\nThe king himself before me, I can hardly believe.\"\n\nBut Saul assured her, \"Fear not, my dear,\nI swear by the Lord, no harm shall you hear.\"\nAnd the woman asked, \"Who shall I bring forth tonight?\"\n\"Bring forth Samuel, the mighty, in all his might.\"\n\nAs Samuel appeared in a ghostly form,\nThe woman cried, \"Saul, you've caused this swarm!\"\nCuriosity caught Saul, he asked, \"Describe what you see.\"\n\"I see an old man in a robe, a sight to be.\"\n\nSaul knew then, oh how he knew,\nThat the spirit before him was Samuel so true.\nHe fell to the ground, with his face in the dirt,\nPaying respects to the ghost, no longer so curt.\n\nSamuel questioned, \"Why have you disturbed me so?\nWhy bring me back from where I did go?\"\nSaul pleaded, \"I'm distressed, my enemy attacks,\nPlease, Samuel, guide me, show me the tracks.\"\n\nBut Samuel rebuked him, \"The Lord has departed,\nNo longer with you, His anger, deeply charted.\nThe kingdom is no longer yours to claim,\nTo David it goes, your neighbor, fame.\"\n\nSaul was reminded of his disobedience, his flaw,\nFor not following the Lord's command with awe.\nThe Amalekites were spared, His wrath not unleashed,\nAnd now destiny dictated the Philistines feast.\n\nThe Lord would deliver Israel and Saul's fate,\nInto the hands of the enemy, sealing their state.\nTomorrow, Saul and his sons, they shall all be with me,\nThe Philistines victorious, a sight to see.\n\nSo remember this tale, my friends, the lesson it imparts,\nObey the Lord's commands, hold them closely to your heart.\nFor when the spirits are summoned, and the future's in doubt,\nOnly through obedience can salvation sprout.",
