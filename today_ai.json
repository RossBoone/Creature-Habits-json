    "Common Themes And Application": "- The importance of following God's word and seeking guidance from it (Psalm 119:105-112)\n- The discovery and restoration of the lost Book of the Law and the repentance of the people of Judah (2 Kings 22:3-20)\n- God's sovereignty, faithfulness, and the remnant of faithful believers (Romans 11:2-10)",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the Word of God. This symbol represents guidance, protection, instruction, and joy. It is depicted as a lamp, a light, and a path that leads to righteousness. The Word of God is seen as a source of wisdom, comfort, and strength in times of suffering and temptation. The psalmist declares their commitment to following God's law and cherishing it as their heritage. Ultimately, the Word of God is seen as something to be cherished and obeyed until the end.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the Book of the Law. In this passage, the discovery of the Book of the Law leads to King Josiah's repentance and the realization of God's anger towards disobedience. This symbolizes the importance of God's Word and the need for obedience to it. Throughout the Bible, the Book of the Law represents divine guidance and serves as a standard for God's people.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the remnant. It refers to a small group of people who remain faithful to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, from Noah and his family being the remnant saved from the flood, to the remnant of faithful Israelites during periods of exile and restoration, ultimately culminating in the remnant of believers in Christ who are chosen by grace.",

    "Summarize1": "The psalmist affirms that God's word is a guide in their life and promises to follow His righteous laws. Despite suffering and challenges, they remain devoted to God's law and find joy in keeping His decrees until the end.",
    "Summarize2": "In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sends his secretary, Shaphan, to the temple to collect money for repairing it. In the process, they discover the Book of the Law. Upon hearing its words, Josiah tears his robes and seeks guidance from the prophet Huldah. She conveys that judgment will come upon the land for their idolatry, but Josiah's humility and repentance have moved the Lord's heart, and he will not experience the full extent of the disaster.",
    "Summarize3": "In Romans 11:2-10, it is explained that God has not rejected his people, the Israelites. Even though many of them have turned away, there is still a remnant chosen by grace. It is emphasized that this grace is not based on works, but on God's favor. Those who did not obtain what they sought were hardened, as noted in the Scriptures. Their eyes and ears were unable to see and hear, and their backs were bent forever.",

    "Behind insights 4": "",
    "SocioSummary1": "The socio-historical context surrounding Psalm 119 is believed to be a period of exile or persecution, such as the Babylonian captivity. During this time, the Jewish people faced challenges to their faith and obedience to God's laws. They were also exposed to pagan beliefs and practices, which threatened their devotion to Yahweh. The author of Psalm 119 expresses their commitment to God's laws and their struggle to remain faithful in the face of persecution and temptations from the wicked. The passage reflects a desire for strength, guidance, and preservation of life from God.",
    "SocioSummary2": "This passage takes place in ancient Israel during King Josiah's reign. It reflects the religious and political instability in the kingdom of Judah at the time. It emphasizes King Josiah's attempt to reconstruct the temple and his discovery of the Book of the Law. The revelation of the Book exposes the people's disobedience and idol worship, leading to a proclamation of impending disaster and judgment on the kingdom.",
    "SocioSummary3": "At the time of writing, the Roman Empire had control over a vast territory including Italy, France, Spain, and parts of North Africa and the Middle East. The Jewish people were dispersed throughout the empire, maintaining their identity. Israel was under Roman rule, and the society was heavily influenced by Greco-Roman culture. There was religious diversity with various cults and beliefs coexisting. The early Christian community faced persecution for challenging Roman authority.",

In contemporary psychology research, this theme aligns with the concept of self-awareness and its impact on personal growth and well-being. Research by Tashiro and Frazier (2003) found that individuals who engage in self-reflection and self-awareness are more likely to experience positive psychological outcomes such as increased happiness and life satisfaction. Similarly, research by Shenhav et al. (2013) suggests that individuals who engage in self-reflection are more likely to make beneficial decisions and exhibit self-control. Thus, self-reflection and personal transformation continues to be recognized as significant factors in psychological research. (Words: 93)\n \nReferences:\n- Shenhav, A., Rand, D., & Greene, J. D.
