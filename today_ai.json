    "Common Themes And Application": "- Themes: Seeking God's presence and dwelling in His courts, dependence on God's strength and favor, acknowledging God's power and sovereignty, repentance and humility before God, the importance of obedience and faithfulness.\n- Life application: Strive to seek and dwell in God's presence, trust in His strength and favor, acknowledge and submit to His power and sovereignty, humbly repent and turn to God, live a life of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the shield. It represents God's protection and favor. Throughout the Bible, the shield is used metaphorically to describe God's role as a protector and source of strength. For example, in Genesis 15:1, God tells Abraham, \"Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield.\" In Ephesians 6:16, Paul describes the shield of faith, which protects believers from the attacks of the enemy. In Psalm 3:3, David declares, \"But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.\" This symbol of the shield continues to develop and emphasize the idea of God's protection and favor throughout the Bible.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the writing on the wall. In this passage, the writing on the wall is a message from God to Belshazzar, foretelling the downfall of his kingdom. This symbol of divine judgment and warning can be seen in similar instances throughout the Bible, such as the writing on the tablets of the Ten Commandments and the prophecy of the handwriting on the wall in the book of Daniel.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the concept of obedience and repentance. In this parable, the symbol is represented by the two sons, one who initially refuses but later obeys, and the other who outwardly agrees but does not follow through. This symbol develops throughout the Bible by highlighting the importance of true repentance and obedience to God's will, as demonstrated by the tax collectors and prostitutes entering the kingdom of God ahead of the religious leaders who did not believe or repent.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "Please provide message",
    "Summarize1": "This passage is a prayer to God, asking Him to listen and show favor to His anointed one. The author expresses his desire to be in God's presence and acknowledges that God is a source of protection, favor, and honor. The passage concludes with a blessing for those who trust in the Lord.",
    "Summarize2": "King Belshazzar summons Daniel to interpret a mysterious writing on the wall. Daniel declines the king's rewards but agrees to interpret the writing, revealing that God has ended Belshazzar's reign and divided his kingdom among the Medes and Persians. That night, Belshazzar is killed, and Darius the Mede takes over the kingdom.",
    "Summarize3": "In this parable, a father asks his two sons to work in the vineyard. The first son initially refuses but later changes his mind and goes, while the second son agrees to go but doesn't. Jesus uses this parable to teach that the tax collectors and prostitutes, who initially didn't follow God's ways but eventually repented, will enter the kingdom of God, while the religious leaders who didn't believe and repent will not.",

    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight is that the psalmist emphasizes the superiority of being in God's presence, even if it means being a lowly doorkeeper in the house of God, compared to dwelling with the wicked. This shows the psalmist's deep longing and appreciation for God's presence and highlights the spiritual benefits of being in a close relationship with God.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight is that the parable is showing the contrast between outward obedience and true repentance. The first son initially refused to work but had a change of heart and obeyed, while the second son said he would obey but did not. This highlights the importance of genuine repentance and faith, rather than mere words or appearances. Additionally, Jesus uses the parable to challenge the religious leaders of his time, emphasizing that tax collectors and prostitutes (often considered immoral and sinful) were more receptive to the message of John the Baptist and were entering the kingdom of God before the religious leaders who did not truly repent. This challenges traditional notions of piety and righteousness.",

    "SocioSummary1": "The historical context of Psalm 84 is uncertain, but it reflects the religious beliefs of the Israelites at the time. They believed they were in the Promised Land given to them by God and worshiped Him as their one true God. The Psalms were written by various authors over a long period of time, so the historical context of each psalm may vary. It is speculated that Psalm 84 may have been written during the time of King David or when the Israelites worshiped at the temple in Jerusalem. The Israelites would have been surrounded by other ancient civilizations with their own beliefs and practices.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage is set during the Babylonian Empire, with Belshazzar as the ruler. Belshazzar uses sacred goblets to worship idols at a feast. Daniel is asked to interpret a mysterious inscription that predicts the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Medes and Persians.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The passage takes place during Roman occupation of Judea, where there were various religious groups and social tensions. The region was under Roman rule, causing unrest among the Jewish population. Judaism was the main religious group, but there were different sects with their own beliefs. Tax collectors and prostitutes were despised in Jewish society. In this context, Jesus uses a parable to criticize religious leaders for not following God's will and praises sinners who repent. This socio-historical setting shapes Jesus' teachings on religious authority and social justice.",

    "Scene1": "The scene from the movie \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" when Lucy first enters the magical world of Narnia is similar to this passage. Lucy is in awe of the beauty and wonder of Narnia and expresses her desire to stay in Narnia and serve in the house of Aslan, the great Lion. Similarly, the passage expresses a longing to be in the presence of God and a willingness to serve in His courts.",

    "Scene2": "The scene from the movie \"The Lion King\" where Simba confronts Scar about his tyrannical rule and Scar's betrayal of Mufasa can be seen as similar to this passage. Simba, like Daniel, speaks out against Scar's actions and exposes his wrongdoing. Both scenes involve a confrontation between a ruler and a figure with insight and wisdom, leading to a change in leadership.",

    "Scene3": "One scene from a movie that is similar to this passage is from the film \"Inception.\" In the movie, the character Dom Cobb asks his team members to join him on a seemingly impossible heist. At first, some of the team members express reluctance and refuse to participate. However, as the movie progresses, one of the reluctant members eventually changes his mind and decides to join the mission, while another member who initially agrees ends up betraying the group. This parallel reflects the concept of actions speaking louder than words and the idea that true intention is shown through one's actions.",

    "psychology1": "Theme: The Benefits of Trusting in God\n\nResearch in psychology has found that individuals who have a strong sense of faith and trust in a higher power tend to experience various mental health benefits. Studies have shown that religious beliefs and practices can contribute to improved well-being, lower levels of anxiety and depression, increased resilience, and greater life satisfaction. Trusting in a higher power provides individuals with a sense of meaning, purpose, and hope, which can positively impact their psychological well-being.

Studies suggest that humility is associated with better interpersonal relationships, increased well-being, and ethical decision-making. Humility is characterized by an accurate view of oneself and a willingness to recognize the contributions of others. This theme from Daniel 5:13-31 supports the idea that humility is essential for moral and ethical leadership, as demonstrated by Daniel's refusal of rewards and his message to King Belshazzar about the importance of humbling oneself before God.",

Actions speak louder than words when it comes to true behavior change. \n\nResearch source: Cialdini, R. B., & Goldstein, N. J. (2004). Social influence: Compliance and conformity.

This ability indicates a higher level of cognitive abilities and social complexity. For example, in a study conducted on European Magpies, researchers found that they passed the \"mirror test\" by showing behaviors such as self-directed pecking or scratching while looking at themselves in the mirror. This finding suggests that these birds have a sense of self and are aware of their own actions, holding themselves accountable for their behavior (Prior, et al., 2008).",
    "biology3": "Theme: Actions speak louder than words.\n\nScientific Finding: In evolutionary biology, the theme of actions speaking louder than words is reflected in the concept of \"costly signaling.\" Costly signaling refers to behaviors or traits that are energetically, socially, or physically costly to an individual but serve as honest signals of their quality or fitness. For example, in the animal kingdom, a peacock's elaborate and energetically costly tail feathers are a signal to potential mates of the peacock's genetic quality and fitness. By investing resources in growing and maintaining the tail feathers, the peacock demonstrates its ability to survive and thrive, which makes it a desirable mate. This concept highlights the importance of actions as reliable indicators of fitness rather than mere verbal claims.\n\nResearch sources:\n- Zahavi, A. (1975).
