    "Common Themes And Application": "- Trusting in God's protection and deliverance in times of trouble.\n- Seeking justice and fairness in relationships and conflicts.\n- Persevering in the face of persecution and opposition.\n- Being obedient to God's commandments and laws.\n- Embracing and proclaiming the truth, even when it is unpopular or met with resistance.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the image of God as a protector and refuge. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as it is used to describe God's relationship with His people. Examples of this development can be seen in Psalm 91:4, where God is described as covering His people with His feathers, and in Isaiah 49:15-16, where God compares His love for His people to a mother's love for her child.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the duty of a brother-in-law to \"carry on the name\" of the deceased brother. This symbol is known as levirate marriage and is seen throughout the Bible as a way to preserve a family line. Examples of this symbol developing include the story of Judah and Tamar in Genesis 38 and the mention of levirate marriage in the Book of Ruth.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the concept of Roman citizenship. Paul asserts his rights as a Roman citizen and uses it as a means of protection. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, as Roman citizenship is repeatedly referenced in various situations of conflict and persecution, highlighting the significance of legal protection and rights for Christians in the early Church.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "Please provide message",
    "Summarize1": "In this passage, David prays to God asking Him to listen to his plea and vindicate him. He assures God of his innocence and asks for protection from those who seek to harm him.",
    "Summarize2": "In Deuteronomy 25:5-10, it is stated that if a man dies without a son, his widow must marry his brother to carry on the family name. If the brother refuses, the widow can go to the elders to address the issue. If he still refuses, she can publicly shame him by removing his sandal and spitting in his face, and he will be known as The Family of the Unsandaled.",
    "Summarize3": "In this passage, Paul is accused by the Jews and the crowd becomes angry, calling for his death. The commander orders Paul to be taken into the barracks and flogged. However, when Paul reveals he is a Roman citizen, the commander becomes alarmed and releases him. The next day, Paul is brought before the Sanhedrin, where he defends himself and causes a dispute between the Pharisees and Sadducees. The commander, fearing for Paul's safety, takes him away to the barracks. Later, the Lord appears to Paul and encourages him to continue testifying in Rome.",

    "Behindinsights1": "No, there are no obvious insights in this passage. However, external research may provide additional historical and cultural context to better understand the themes and language used in the passage.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that Paul's Roman citizenship protected him from being flogged without a trial. This shows that Roman citizenship carried certain rights and privileges, even in the context of the Roman Empire. Additionally, Paul's assertion that he was a Pharisee and his belief in the resurrection of the dead caused a division among the Sanhedrin, highlighting the theological differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees.",

    "SocioSummary1": "During the time of King David's reign in ancient Israel, this psalm is believed to have been written. David faced opposition from neighboring nations and internal threats, including rebellions and power struggles. He also experienced personal challenges and struggles. This psalm is seen as a prayer seeking God's help and protection against enemies, and resonates with the socio-historical situation of that time.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage was written in ancient Israel during Moses' time. Family and inheritance were important, and it was expected for a brother-in-law to marry his brother's widow to preserve the family line and inheritance rights. Failing to do so was dishonorable and brought shame to the individual and their family. These laws were meant to maintain social order and ensure the continuation of family lines.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The passage in Acts 22:22-23:11 takes place during the Roman occupation of Jerusalem, where the Jewish people were subject to Roman rule and had limited autonomy. It also highlights the divisions between the Pharisees and Sadducees, two Jewish religious factions with contrasting beliefs. The passage shows the privileges and challenges faced by Roman citizens, as Paul, a Roman citizen, is protected from mistreatment. This socio-historical context helps to understand the interactions and conflicts described in the passage.",

    "Scene1": "The scene in the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" where Andy Dufresne prays for vindication and protection in his jail cell is similar to this passage.

    "Scene2": "The scene from the movie \"Fiddler on the Roof\" where the character Tzeitel confronts her father about her arranged marriage comes close to the passage. Tzeitel challenges the tradition and asks her father to let her marry the man she loves. In both instances, the characters question the cultural practice of family duty and try to break free from the expected roles.",

    "Scene3": "A similar scene from a movie is the courtroom scene in \"A Few Good Men\" where the defendant, played by Tom Cruise, makes a revelation that changes the course of the trial and causes a diversion among the lawyers and the audience.

    "psychology1": "The theme of this passage is the plea for justice and protection from enemies. In contemporary psychology research, this theme can be related to the study of stress and coping mechanisms. Research shows that individuals who perceive themselves to be under threat or facing adversities often seek support from higher powers or engage in prayer as a way to cope and find solace. These practices can provide individuals with a sense of protection and help them navigate challenging situations. (Source: Koenig, H. G., King, D. E., & Carson, V. B. (2012).

    "psychology2": "Theme: The importance of family lineage and the duty to preserve it.\n\nContemporary Psychology Research:\nResearch confirms that individuals have an inherent need for a sense of belonging and identity through their family lineage. Maintaining connections to one's family history has been found to positively impact mental health and emotional well-being. Several studies suggest that a strong understanding of family heritage can contribute to a person's overall self-esteem, resilience, and a sense of purpose in life (Yau, Liem, & Oei, 2016; Nikneshan, Auerbach, Rudy, & Lewin, 2019).",

For example, young birds will follow the movements of their parents and imitate their actions, relying on them for food and protection. This behavior demonstrates their trust in their parents' ability to lead them in the right direction and keep them safe.\n\nResearch Sources: \n1.

This is particularly evident in the formation of factions or subgroups within larger groups. These divisions can be driven by differences in values, beliefs, goals, or strategies, leading to disputes and competition for resources.
