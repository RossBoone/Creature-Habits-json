    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the Lord as a provider and protector. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, with examples including God providing for the Israelites in the wilderness, Jesus feeding the multitudes, and God's care for the oppressed and vulnerable throughout both the Old and New Testaments. This symbol emphasizes God's faithfulness and love for His people.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the \"horn\" which symbolizes strength. Throughout the Bible, the horn is used to represent power, authority, and victory. For example, in Psalm 89:17, it says, \"For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.\" The symbol of the horn develops to reveal God as the source of strength and the one who lifts up the weak and oppressed. This symbol is a recurring theme in the Bible, reminding believers of God's power and ability to bring deliverance.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is baptism. It is mentioned multiple times in different forms - John the Baptist preaches a baptism of repentance, John baptizes with water but the coming Messiah will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire. Baptism represents purification, repentance, and receiving the Spirit of God, and it develops throughout the Bible as a significant rite of initiation and forgiveness of sins.",

    "psychology1": "The theme of this text is the belief that God is just and compassionate, particularly towards the oppressed, hungry, blind, foreigner, fatherless, and widow. In contemporary psychology research, studies have found that acts of compassion and kindness towards others can improve mental health and well-being (e.g., Piff et al., 2010; Post et al., 2019).
