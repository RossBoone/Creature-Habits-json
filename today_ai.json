    "Common Themes And Application": "- Trusting in God's protection and deliverance\n- Seeking guidance and direction from God\n- The importance of obedience to God's commandments\n- Facing opposition and standing firm in one's faith\n- Recognizing God's authority and power",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the image of God as a protector and refuge. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as it is used to describe God's relationship with His people. Examples of this development can be seen in Psalm 91:4, where God is described as covering His people with His feathers, and in Isaiah 49:15-16, where God compares His love for His people to a mother's love for her child.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the name of God. In Exodus 3:13-20, God reveals His name to Moses as \"I am who I am\" or \"Yahweh\". This name is significant because it represents God's eternal and unchanging nature. Throughout the Bible, this name is used to emphasize God's authority, presence, and faithfulness.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the authority of Jesus. This symbol develops throughout the Bible by showing how Jesus claims and demonstrates his authority through his teachings, miracles, and ultimately through his resurrection. This authority is questioned by religious leaders and is a central theme in the Gospel narratives.",

    "Summarize1": "In this passage, David prays to God asking Him to listen to his plea and vindicate him. He assures God of his innocence and asks for protection from those who seek to harm him.",
    "Summarize2": "",
    "Summarize3": "The chief priests and teachers of the law questioned Jesus about his authority. Jesus asked them about John's baptism, and they were unsure how to respond. Jesus refused to answer their question.",

    "Behindinsights1": "No, there are no obvious insights in this passage. However, external research may provide additional historical and cultural context to better understand the themes and language used in the passage.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that Jesus's response to the question about his authority can be seen as a masterful rhetorical move. By asking the religious leaders about the authority of John the Baptist, Jesus puts them in a dilemma where they cannot give a straightforward answer without undermining their own credibility.",

    "SocioSummary1": "During the time of King David's reign in ancient Israel, this psalm is believed to have been written. David faced opposition from neighboring nations and internal threats, including rebellions and power struggles. He also experienced personal challenges and struggles. This psalm is seen as a prayer seeking God's help and protection against enemies, and resonates with the socio-historical situation of that time.",
    "SocioSummary2": "Exodus 3:13-20 was written during a time when the Israelites were oppressed in Egypt. Moses, acting on behalf of God, is preparing to confront the Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites. God assures Moses of his presence and power, promising to perform miracles to persuade the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go.",
    "SocioSummary3": "During the time of Jesus' ministry, Judea was under Roman occupation. Jewish religious leaders held authority within the Jewish community, but their power was limited due to Roman rule. The Jewish people were awaiting the arrival of the Messiah and had a heightened sense of religious tension. In Luke 20:1-8, the chief priests and teachers of the law question Jesus' authority, motivated by a desire to maintain their own control and authority. They hesitate to deny John the Baptist's authority due to fear of backlash from the people. This passage reflects the complex dynamics of power, religious tensions, and public opinion during that time.",
    "SocioSummary4": "I'm sorry, but without a specific message or topic, I cannot provide a summary. Could you please provide more information or specify what you would like summarized?",
    "Scene1": "The scene in the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" where Andy Dufresne prays for vindication and protection in his jail cell is similar to this passage. Andy, like David, is innocent and seeks divine intervention and guidance while facing trials and enemies. Both express trust in God's love and ask for deliverance from their adversaries.",

    "Scene2": "The scene in the movie \"The Ten Commandments\" where Moses encounters the burning bush parallels this passage. In the movie, Moses asks God for His name, and God responds with \"I am who I am,\" indicating His eternal nature. God then instructs Moses to go to the Israelites and lead them out of Egypt, just as He does in the passage from Exodus.",
    "scenelink2": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Ten+Commandments+Moses+encounters+burning+bush",
    "Scene3": "The scene from the movie \"Inception\" is similar to this passage. In the movie, the character Dom Cobb is interrogated by Saito regarding his ability to enter people's dreams. Saito questions Cobb's authority and knowledge, to which Cobb responds by turning the tables and questioning Saito's understanding of the dreams and their origin. Just like in the passage, this scene involves a back-and-forth questioning of authority and a refusal to directly answer.",

    "emily2": "In desert's midst, Moses did inquire,\n\"What is your name?\" he questioned the fire.\nGod replied, \"I am who I am,\nTell the Israelites, I am is the great I AM.\"\n\nThe God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\nUnseen, yet present, not subject to whims.\nCalled forever by this eternal name,\nFrom generation to generation, the same.\n\nGo, Moses, speak to the elders of old,\nTell them of the God who watches their woe.\nFrom misery in Egypt, He will free,\nLeading to Canaan's land, where milk and honey be.\n\nThough the king resists, with stubborn might,\nGod's hand will compel, a fearsome sight.\nWonders shall strike, the Egyptians astound,\nUntil their resistance is broken, unbound.\n\nOh, how this scripture echoes true today,\nWhen we, like Moses, seek answers on our way.\nGod, the Great I AM, still whispers His name,\nGuiding us through trials, our lives to reclaim.",
    "emily3": "In temple courts, where Jesus taught,\nThe priests and teachers sought\nTo challenge Him, demand His claim\nOf authority, by what name?\n\nThey questioned, \"By whose power stand\nThy deeds and teachings, close at hand?\"\nBut Jesus, wise, did not comply\nInstead, a question, He supplied.\n\n\"John's baptism, from heaven high\nOr born of human hearts awry?\"\nThey whispered thoughts amidst the crowd\nFearful of denouncing aloud.\n\n\"For if we claim the heavenly call\nHe'll challenge our belief, appall.\nBut if we say, a human choice,\nThe people's wrath will find a voice.\"\n\nThey answered then, in doubt they drew,\n\"We know not whence His source accrue.\"\nTo which Christ spoke, a gentle sting,\n\"The answer too, I shall not bring.\"\n\nThe authority, question unmet,\nIn these few verses, we are set.\nFor in our lives, do we take heed,\nThe power claimed, in word and deed?\n\nDo we seek truth, or just comply,\nIn fear of judgment, reason why?\nAnd when the road ahead is dim,\nCan we trust in the light within?\n\nUnanswered questions, they may lay,\nBut in the depths, we'll find our way.\nFor true authority resides,\nIn hearts aligned with love's pure tides.",

    "Snoop2": "Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell\n'Bout Moses and God, it's gonna be swell\nMoses asked God, \"What should I say?\"\nWhen the Israelites ask 'bout your name today?\n\nGod replied, \"I am who I am, my man\nTell 'em 'I am' sent you, they'll understand\"\nGod said, \"My name is forever, don't you see?\nFor generations, they gonna call on me\"\n\nNow Moses, gather the elders, make it quick\nTell 'em God appeared, got a message to stick\nHe said, \"I've seen your pain in Egypt's land\nBut I promise to take you to a better strand\"\n\nThe land of Canaan, flowing with milk and honey\nLeave behind the misery, ain't that funny?\nThe elders will listen, that's for sure\nThen go to the king, his reign won't endure\n\n\"Tell Pharaoh, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews\nHas met with us, it's time to make moves\nWe need a three-day trip to worship and pray\nIn the wilderness, where we gon' stay'\"\n\nBut I know Pharaoh won't release his grip\nNo matter how much we try to equip\nSo I'll stretch my hand, perform wonders galore\nTill Pharaoh begs us to walk out the door\n\nYou see, miracles gon' strike the Egyptians hard\nWith my mighty hand, I'll play my card\nAfter that, Pharaoh won't say no more\nFreedom's knocking, he will let you go for sure",
    "Snoop3": "Yo, listen up y'all, I got a story to tell,\n'Bout Jesus preachin' in the temple, oh so well.\nThe chief priests, teachers of the law, and the elders too,\nThey stepped to Jesus, askin', \"Yo, who authorized you?\"\n\nThey said, \"Jesus, tell us, where'd you get this power?\nWho gave you the authority, in this very hour?\"\nBut Jesus, slick as ever, turned the tables 'round,\nHe said, \"I'll ask you a question, let's hear your sound.\"\n\nHe asked 'em 'bout John, his baptism's claim,\nWas it divine, or just a human game?\nThey whispered amongst themselves, tryna make a choice,\nSayin', \"If we say it's from heaven, we better speak with one voice.\"\n\n\"If we deny it's divine, the people will get wild,\nThey believed in John, they thought he was a child\nOf the Most High, a prophet, with words so true,\nSo what should we do, Jesus, tell us, what's your view?\"\n\nBut those sly priests, they played it cool,\nThey said, \"We don't know, man, we ain't nobody's fool.\"\nAnd Jesus, smirkin' and smilin', kept it straight,\nHe said, \"Well, then guess what? Yo, I won't take the bait.\"\n\nHe didn't reveal his authority, no need to brag,\nHe left 'em wonderin', while they were caught in a drag.\nSo remember this tale, my friends, it's a lesson for all,\nSometimes keepin' silent can make those doubters fall.",

    "psychology1": "The theme of this passage is the plea for justice and protection from enemies. In contemporary psychology research, this theme can be related to the study of stress and coping mechanisms. Research shows that individuals who perceive themselves to be under threat or facing adversities often seek support from higher powers or engage in prayer as a way to cope and find solace. These practices can provide individuals with a sense of protection and help them navigate challenging situations. (Source: Koenig, H. G., King, D. E., & Carson, V. B. (2012). Handbook of religion and health.)",
    "psychology2": "The theme of identity and self-concept can be applied to findings in contemporary psychology research. Research has shown that individuals' self-concept is influenced by their sense of identity, including their racial, ethnic, and cultural identities. This can impact their psychological well-being, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. For example, a study by Phinney and Alipuria (1990) found that individuals with a strong sense of ethnic identity experienced higher levels of self-esteem and psychological well-being.",
    "psychology3": "Theme: Questioning Authority and Perceived Legitimacy\n\nContemporary psychology research has explored the theme of questioning authority and perceived legitimacy in various ways. For example, studies have examined the factors influencing individuals' perceptions of authority figures' legitimacy and the consequences of questioning authority. Research shows that people are more likely to accept authorities who exhibit fairness, consistency, and expertise. Additionally, questioning authority can lead to improved decision-making and greater societal accountability (Birchall & Maddux, 2018; Campbell, 2020).\n\nReferences:\nBirchall, D., & Maddux, W. W.

    "biology1": "Theme: Trusting in the guidance and protection of God\n\nScientific Finding: In the field of ethology (the study of animal behavior), research has shown that offspring of certain species, such as birds and mammals, display behaviors that indicate they trust in the guidance and protection of their parents. For example, young birds will follow the movements of their parents and imitate their actions, relying on them for food and protection. This behavior demonstrates their trust in their parents' ability to lead them in the right direction and keep them safe.\n\nResearch Sources: \n1.
