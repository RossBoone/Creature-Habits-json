    "Common Themes And Application": "- The importance of following God's commandments and seeking His guidance for a righteous life.\n- The value of seeking and acquiring wisdom, understanding, and knowledge.\n- The significance of upholding and honoring marriage as God intended it to be.\n- The need to hold firmly to God's teachings and to live according to His standards in a world that may challenge them.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the Word of God (or God's commands, laws, statutes, precepts, and decrees). The psalmist emphasizes the importance of living according to God's word, hiding it in their heart to avoid sin, recounting it with their lips, rejoicing in following it, meditating on it, and delighting in it. This symbol develops throughout the Bible, with numerous references to the word of God as a source of guidance, wisdom, and spiritual nourishment for believers.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is wisdom. Wisdom is portrayed as a valuable treasure or hidden treasure that must be sought after and pursued. It is depicted as something that brings knowledge, understanding, and protection, and it saves one from the ways of wickedness. Wisdom is a recurring theme in Proverbs and is also mentioned in various other books of the Bible, such as Job, Ecclesiastes, and James.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the symbol of marriage. Marriage is presented as a sacred union between a man and a woman, symbolizing the unity and oneness ordained by God. The development of this symbol can be seen in various passages throughout the Bible, such as in Genesis 2:24 where marriage is first established, and in Ephesians 5:22-33 where it is associated with Christ's relationship with the church. Overall, the Bible portrays marriage as a symbolic representation of the divine bond between God and His people.",

    "Summarize1": "In this passage from Psalm 119, the author asks how a young person can stay pure and answers by saying it is through living according to God's word. They express their desire to seek God with all their heart and not stray from His commands. The author recognizes the importance of hiding God's word in their heart to avoid sin. They praise the Lord and ask for His teachings. They rejoice in following God's statutes and meditate on His precepts. They delight in God's decrees and commit to not neglect His word.",
    "Summarize2": "The passage encourages seeking wisdom and understanding, as it brings knowledge of God. Wisdom brings success and protection, guiding one towards righteousness and guarding against the ways of the wicked.",
    "Summarize3": "In Matthew 19:1-12, the Pharisees ask Jesus about divorce, questioning if it is lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason. Jesus responds by explaining that from the beginning, God intended for a man and woman to be joined together and for no one to separate them. He acknowledges that Moses allowed divorce due to the hardness of people's hearts, but emphasizes that this was not how it was meant to be. Jesus states that anyone who divorces their spouse and remarries commits adultery, except in cases of sexual immorality. The disciples express their concern over this teaching, but Jesus explains that not everyone is capable of accepting it. He mentions that some people choose to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.",
    "Summarize4": "",
    "Behindinsights1": "According to external research, this passage highlights the importance of adhering to God's word and seeking His guidance in order to stay on the path of purity. It emphasizes the significance of studying and memorizing Scripture to avoid sinning against God. Additionally, it encourages reciting and meditating on God's laws, finding joy in following His statutes, and not neglecting His word.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight is that Jesus' teaching on divorce challenged the prevailing interpretation of the law at that time. The Pharisees believed that divorce was permissible for any reason, but Jesus emphasized that divorce should only be allowed in cases of sexual immorality. This stricter view on divorce was revolutionary and presented a higher standard for marital commitment.",
    "Behind insights 4": "",
    "SocioSummary1": "The Book of Psalms, including Psalm 119, was likely written during the time of the monarchy in ancient Israel. This period was marked by external threats from neighboring nations and empires, as well as internal challenges such as idolatry and political and religious tensions. The psalms reflect the Israelites' search for guidance and solace in their faith during these difficult times, with Psalm 119 expressing a devotion to God's word and a desire for spiritual renewal.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage was written in ancient Israelite society during the development of wisdom literature. It emphasizes the importance of seeking wisdom and understanding for righteousness and protection. The passage promotes the belief that following God's commands leads to guidance and success. It also warns against associating with wicked individuals.",
    "SocioSummary3": "During this time under Roman rule, the Pharisees approached Jesus to test his beliefs on divorce. They referred to Moses' commandment allowing men to give their wives certificates of divorce, which was found in the Mosaic Law. In Roman society, men had the legal right to divorce their wives while women had limited rights. It is worth noting that the Jewish people at this time were also anticipating the arrival of the Messiah and were seeking religious leaders who could provide guidance on Jewish law and practice.",

In the movie, the main characters, played by Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, discuss their differing opinions on marriage and divorce.
