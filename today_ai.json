    "Common Themes And Application": "- Themes: Seeking God's guidance and teachings, finding joy in His laws and commandments, repentance, God's mercy and forgiveness, pride and humility, God's invitation and inclusion of all people.\n- Life Application: Trusting in God's guidance and seeking His wisdom, finding joy in studying and obeying His Word, turning away from sinful ways and embracing repentance, humbling ourselves before God, accepting God's invitation to be part of His kingdom and sharing His message of salvation with others.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the \"word\" or \"law\" of God. The psalmist recognizes the importance of God's commands, seeking understanding and wisdom from them. The psalmist's affliction serves as a way to learn and obey God's word. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as God's word is seen as the source of guidance, wisdom, and salvation for His people.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The recurring symbol in these verses is peace. Throughout the Bible, peace is presented as a desired state for God's people. In Isaiah 57:19, the Lord promises to bring peace to Israel's mourners and heal them. In other verses, such as Isaiah 9:6 and Luke 2:14, peace is associated with the coming of Christ. Ultimately, peace is achieved through reconciliation with God, and it is a central theme throughout the Bible.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the feast or banquet, which symbolizes the kingdom of God. The development of this symbol can be seen throughout the Bible, such as in Isaiah 25:6-9 where a lavish feast is described as a symbol of God's salvation and the ultimate victory of his people. In Matthew 22:1-14, Jesus tells the Parable of the Wedding Banquet, reinforcing the idea that the kingdom of God is like a banquet, but those who make excuses or reject the invitation will not partake in it.",

    "Summarize1": "In this psalm, the author expresses their desire for God to do good to them according to His word. They ask for knowledge and good judgment, acknowledging their trust in God's commands. The author recognizes that before they were afflicted, they went astray, but now they obey God's word. They praise God for His goodness and ask Him to teach them His decrees. Despite being lied about by the arrogant, the author remains devoted to obeying God's precepts with all their heart. While the hearts of the arrogant are callous, the author finds delight in God's law. They acknowledge that it was good for them to be afflicted so that they could learn God's decrees. The law from God's mouth is more precious to the author than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.",
    "Summarize2": "In Isaiah 57:14-21, God promises comfort and restoration to the contrite and humble. He will not accuse or be angry forever, but will heal and guide his people, bringing peace to both near and far. However, there is no peace for the wicked.",
    "Summarize3": "In this parable, Jesus tells of a man who prepares a great banquet and invites many guests. However, those who were invited all make excuses not to attend. The man then invites the poor, crippled, blind, and lame to come instead. The master commands his servant to go out to the roads and country lanes and compel people to come in so that his house will be full. The parable teaches that those who reject the invitation to God's kingdom will not partake in the feast.",

    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it highlights the author's perspective on affliction. The author sees affliction as a means to obedience and learning God's decrees. This suggests that difficult experiences can shape individuals' spiritual growth and deepen their understanding of God's word.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it reflects the theme of rejection and acceptance. The initial guests who were invited to the banquet make excuses and reject the invitation, while the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame are accepted and brought in. This can be seen as a metaphor for how the Kingdom of God welcomes those who are often disregarded or marginalized in society.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 119 was likely written during the 5th century BCE in post-exilic Israel. The Jewish people had returned to Jerusalem after being exiled to Babylon and were rebuilding their community. The psalm reflects the writer's religious devotion and commitment, seeking God's guidance and praising the importance of following God's commands. It highlights the contrast between the writer's dedication to God and the wickedness of their adversaries. The psalmist acknowledges that affliction is important for spiritual development and recognizes the value of God's teachings over material wealth.",
    "SocioSummary2": "This passage was written during the exile of the Israelites in Babylon, offering comfort and hope to the repentant ones. God assures them of His presence, healing, and restoration. However, God also expresses anger and judgment towards those who continue in their wicked ways.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The parable of the Great Banquet in Luke 14:15-24 was written in the first century CE in the region of Palestine, which was under Roman rule. The Jewish people in Palestine were living under Roman occupation and faced social and economic disparities. The parable addresses these inequalities and challenges the behavior of the privileged guests who prioritize their own interests over communal obligations. Jesus emphasizes the inclusion of marginalized groups, critiquing the socially privileged and promoting a message of equality and inclusion in the kingdom of God.",
    "SocioSummary4": "I'm sorry, but without a specific message or topic, I cannot provide a summary. Could you please provide more information or specify what you would like summarized?",
    "Scene1": "In the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" there is a scene where Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) is talking to his friend Red (played by Morgan Freeman) about his experiences in prison. Andy expresses his belief in the power of hope and how he finds solace in books. This scene parallels the passage's theme of finding strength and guidance in obeying a higher authority and valuing it more than material wealth.",

    "Scene2": "This passage from Isaiah 57:14-21 describes God's promise to comfort and restore the contrite and lowly in spirit. It speaks of God's willingness to revive and heal those who repent and turn away from their sinful ways. In a similar vein, the scene in the movie \"Les Mis?rables\" where Jean Valjean is shown mercy and forgiveness by the Bishop after stealing from him reflects the theme of redemption and restoration in this passage.",

However, when it comes time for the banquet, the invited guests make excuses and do not attend, prompting the host to open up the invitation to others.",
