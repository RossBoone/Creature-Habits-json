    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the image of the needy being delivered and saved by God. This theme recurs throughout the Bible, from God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt to Jesus saving humanity through his death and resurrection. It represents God's compassion, mercy, and salvation for those who are powerless and in need.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the land of Israel. It is represented as a covenantal promise and a place of judgment and purification. In these verses, God speaks of gathering his people from the nations to bring them into the land, judge them, purge those who rebel, accept their offerings, and prove his holiness through them. This theme of the land of Israel as a symbol of God's covenant and judgment is seen throughout the Old Testament and continues in the New Testament with the belief in the restoration of Israel.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the healing of the shriveled hand. This symbolizes the power and authority of Jesus to restore and bring wholeness. In other passages, Jesus heals various physical ailments, illustrating his ability to heal not just physical but also spiritual brokenness. Ultimately, this symbol develops into the concept of Jesus as the ultimate healer and savior.",

    "Summarize1": "The psalmist calls on God to deliver him out of love and for God's name's sake. He describes his poor and wounded state, feeling like a fading shadow. Despite being scorned and attacked, he asks God to save him and bring shame to his accusers. The psalmist vows to praise God and trusts that He will protect the needy.",
    "Summarize2": "In Ezekiel 20:33-44, God declares that He will reign over the people with a mighty hand and punish those who rebel against Him. He will bring them back to their land and judge them. Despite their idolatry, He will eventually accept them and be proved holy through them. They will remember their wrongdoing and recognize God's righteousness. God will deal with them for His own sake and not according to their evil ways.",
    "Summarize3": "Jesus teaches in a synagogue and heals a man with a shriveled hand on the Sabbath. The Pharisees and teachers of the law question Jesus' actions, but he defends his actions and the man's hand is restored. The religious leaders become angry and plot against Jesus.",
    "Summarize4": "Please provide message",
    "Behindinsights1": "An interesting insight about this passage is that the psalmist, in his plea for deliverance, acknowledges his own poor and needy state. He describes his physical and emotional suffering, as well as being an object of scorn. However, he also expresses his trust in God's unfailing love and desire for his enemies to be put to shame. Furthermore, he affirms his commitment to praise and worship God, recognizing God as the savior of the needy.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight from external research is that the healing of the man with the shriveled hand challenged the religious leaders' interpretation of Sabbath observance. According to Jewish law, medical treatments that were deemed life-threatening could be performed on the Sabbath, but other treatments were generally prohibited. Jesus' healing on the Sabbath, in this case, provoked controversy and conflict with the Pharisees and teachers of the law.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 109 reflects the personal distress of the writer, who is facing opposition and accusations. The exact historical context is unclear, but it is likely that the distress can be attributed to the periods of conflict and instability in ancient Israel, including invasions and internal power struggles. The psalmist's plea for deliverance reflects the challenging socio-political climate of the time.",
    "SocioSummary2": "This passage is set during the exile of the people of Israel in Babylon. God is speaking through Ezekiel, assuring the people that they will return to their land after a time of punishment and purification. God emphasizes his sovereignty and declares that he will act for his own sake, without considering the people's behavior or customs.",
    "SocioSummary3": "In the 1st century, Palestine was under Roman rule, and the Jewish population was subjected to Roman governors and appointed Jewish religious leaders. The Pharisees and teachers of the law held religious authority and were influential in interpreting Jewish law. They closely observed Jesus, fearing his growing popularity and teachings would disrupt the existing power structures and provoke a response from the Romans. The mention of the Sabbath in this passage highlights their strict adherence to Jewish religious laws and their attempt to find any reason to accuse Jesus of breaking them.",

    "Scene1": "A scene from the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is similar to this passage. In the film, Andy Dufresne, who is wrongly imprisoned, prays for help and deliverance, expressing his feelings of being poor, needy, and wounded. He also longs for his accusers to be put to shame and for justice to be served. This parallels the tone and themes present in the passage from Psalm 109:21-31.",

    "Scene2": "The scene from the movie \"The Ten Commandments\" where Moses confronts the people of Israel after they worship the golden calf is similar to this passage. Moses declares judgment and punishment for their disobedience and idolatry, but also offers the hope of reconciliation and redemption if they turn back to God.",

    "Scene3": "In the movie \"The Dark Knight,\" there is a scene where Batman is interrogating the Joker in a police interrogation room. The Joker, who is restrained and has a shriveled hand, provokes Batman by challenging him morally and psychologically. The scene mirrors Luke 6:6-11 because just like Jesus' confrontation with the Pharisees, Batman faces intense scrutiny and opposition from the Joker and other law enforcement officials.",
