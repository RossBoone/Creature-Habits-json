    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the \"horn.\" In Psalm 89, the horn symbolizes strength and glory. It is used to describe God's power (verse 17) and the exalted status of David's reign (verse 24). Throughout the Bible, the symbol of the horn develops to represent strength, power, and victory, often associated with God's deliverance and redemption of His people.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is salvation. Throughout the Bible, salvation is depicted as an act of God's deliverance and redemption. Examples include the salvation of Noah and his family from the flood, the salvation of Israel from slavery in Egypt, and ultimately, the salvation of all humanity through Jesus Christ. Salvation represents God's love, mercy, and grace towards humanity, offering forgiveness and eternal life.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is the image of God's chosen servant. This symbol develops throughout the Bible as a representation of Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament, Isaiah prophesied about this servant who would bring justice, and in the New Testament, Jesus fulfills this prophecy. The imagery of a bruised reed and a smoldering wick highlights the servant's gentle and compassionate nature. This symbol emphasizes Jesus' role as the hope for the nations.",

    "Summarize2": "In Isaiah 51:1-16, God speaks to those who seek Him and pursue righteousness. He reminds them to trust in Him and look to their ancestors, Abraham and Sarah, who He blessed and made into a great nation. God promises to comfort Zion, transforming her deserts into a beautiful garden. He declares that His righteousness and salvation are near, and His justice will shine among the nations. He encourages his people not to fear the reproach of others, as His righteousness and salvation will endure forever. God calls on His arm to awaken and rescue His people, reminding them of the great things He has done in the past, such as cutting Rahab apart and drying up the sea. Those who have been rescued by the Lord will return to Zion with singing and everlasting joy. God reassures His people that He is the one who comforts them, and they should not fear mere mortals or forget their Maker. He promises to free the prisoners and provide for them. He proclaims Himself as the Lord Almighty, who controls the sea and all creation. God declares that He has put His words in His people's mouths and covered them with His protection. He claims Zion as His own people.",
    "Summarize3": "Jesus withdrew from a place where people were plotting against him. He healed many and warned them not to tell others about him.

    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight from external research is that the passage in Matthew 12:15-21, specifically the reference to Isaiah 42:1-4, is a fulfillment of a prophecy about the coming Messiah. This passage in Isaiah is known as the \"Servant Song,\" and it describes the characteristics and mission of the servant of God. The servant, whom God has chosen and loves, will bring justice to the nations, but he will do so gently and without making a lot of noise. This reference in Matthew highlights Jesus as the fulfillment of this prophecy and emphasizes his role as the chosen servant of God.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 89 is a royal psalm that praises God's faithfulness and sovereignty in relation to the kingship of David. It asserts that God has made a covenant with David and his descendants, promising that his line will continue forever. The precise socio-historical situation at the time of writing is difficult to determine, but it may have been during a period of political turmoil or hardship for the Davidic dynasty or the people of Israel. The psalm may have been edited or modified over time for different contexts.",
    "SocioSummary2": "This passage was written during the Babylonian exile and the return of the Israelites to their homeland. It reminds the people of their origins and covenant with God, and reassures them of God's faithfulness and promise to restore Zion. It also encourages them to not fear human oppression, as God's righteousness and salvation will endure forever.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The passage in Matthew 12:15-21 is set in a time of Roman occupation in Palestine during the 1st century CE. The Jewish people were living under Roman rule, which led to political unrest and a desire for liberation. The passage references a prophecy from Isaiah about a servant who would bring justice, suggesting that the Jewish people were hoping for a messianic figure to deliver them from Roman oppression. Jesus' healing of the sick and his popularity among the crowds also indicate a sense of anticipation and hope.",

This shows his restraint and compassion, similar to the passage describing Jesus not quarreling or crying out and not breaking a bruised reed or snuffing out a smoldering wick.",
