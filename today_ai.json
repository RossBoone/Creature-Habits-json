    "Common Themes And Application": "Themes:\n- Trust and dependence on God\n- Unwavering faith in God's sovereignty\n- God's wisdom and power\n\nLife application:\n- Humbly seek God's guidance and direction in all circumstances\n- Trust in God's timing and His plans, even in difficult times\n- Live a life of obedience and submission to God's will\n- Have assurance in the future resurrection and eternal judgment.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is \"eyes.\" In this passage, the Psalmist lifts up their eyes to God and compares their dependence on God to the eyes of a slave looking to their master. Throughout the Bible, \"eyes\" often symbolize a longing for God's guidance, mercy, and deliverance. Examples include passages like Psalm 121:1-2 and Isaiah 55:6-7.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the power and might of God. This is seen in Bildad's description of God's dominion and awe in establishing order in the heavens, and in Job's acknowledgement of God's power in creating and controlling the elements of nature. This symbol of God's power and might develops throughout the Bible, highlighting His sovereignty and authority over all creation.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is \"life.\" In these verses, Jesus claims authority to give life and judge, paralleling the Father who raises the dead and grants life. This symbol of life appears throughout the Bible, from God creating life in Genesis to Jesus resurrecting Lazarus and ultimately offering eternal life through belief in him.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "Please provide message",
    "Summarize1": "In Psalm 123, the psalmist expresses their dependence on God, comparing it to the reliance of a slave on their master. They ask for God's mercy as they have endured contempt and ridicule from the arrogant and proud.",
    "Summarize2": "In this passage, Bildad responds to Job by asserting that only God is righteous and pure, and that humans are inferior to Him. Job then acknowledges the power and wisdom of God, describing His control over the earth and His ability to perform great works.",
    "Summarize3": "In John 5:19-29, Jesus explains that he can only do what he sees his Father doing, and the Father has entrusted all judgment to him. Those who believe in Jesus will have eternal life and will not be judged. A time is coming when the dead will hear Jesus's voice and those who have done good will rise to live, while those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.",
    "Summarize4": "",
    "Behindinsights1": "Some possible insights from external research could include:\n\n- The mention of \"a song of ascents\" in the psalm heading suggests that this psalm may have been sung by pilgrims as they made their way up to Jerusalem for worship.\n- The psalmist uses the metaphor of a slave looking to their master's hand, highlighting their dependence and submission to the Lord.\n- The psalmist's plea for God's mercy indicates that they are in a desperate and vulnerable state, likely facing persecution or mistreatment from others.\n- The psalm reflects a contrast between the humble and submissive posture of the psalmist and the arrogance and contempt of their adversaries.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "According to external research, a significant insight not explicitly mentioned in the passage is the concept of the Trinity. The passage suggests that the Father and the Son are one, as the Son can do only what he sees the Father doing, and the Father has entrusted all judgment to the Son. This concept aligns with the Christian belief in the triune nature of God, where God exists as three persons in one: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.",

    "SocioSummary1": "The exact situation surrounding the writing of Psalm 123 is not mentioned in the text, but it was likely composed during times of hardship and oppression, such as the Babylonian exile or periods of geopolitical tension. The psalms were written and compiled over a long period of time, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific historical context for each one. However, the themes of longing for mercy and deliverance, as well as the need for divine protection, are universal and can be applied to various historical circumstances.",
    "SocioSummary2": "Bildad emphasizes the power and authority of God in the ancient Near Eastern society, while Job questions his limited perspective and acknowledges the vastness of God's creation.",
    "SocioSummary3": "Jesus was teaching and performing miracles in Judea, which was under Roman rule at the time. The Jewish people were living under Roman occupation and subject to Roman laws. The religious leaders, like the Pharisees, were influential in Judea but clashed with Jesus. There were also various factions and sects with different beliefs, and there was an expectation among the Jewish people for the Messiah to deliver them from foreign oppression. This context influenced the reactions and challenges that Jesus faced during his ministry.",

    "Scene1": "The scene from the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" where Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) stands in the rain with his arms outstretched, looking up at the sky, symbolizing his hope and desire for redemption and mercy. The passage reflects the same sentiment of looking up to a higher power for mercy and protection.",

    "Scene2": "The scene in the movie \"The Social Network\" where Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is being questioned by the Winklevoss twins and their lawyer at a deposition.
