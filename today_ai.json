    "Common Themes And Application": "- The theme of God's sovereignty and authority over all creation is present in all three passages.\n- The Psalms passage emphasizes the holiness and worship of God.\n- The Isaiah passage speaks of the security and protection that comes from dwelling in God's presence.\n- The Revelation passage emphasizes the return of Christ, the urgency of accepting his salvation, and the promise of eternal life.",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the concept of \"the King of glory.\" This symbol represents God's sovereignty, power, and victory. It develops throughout the Bible as a reflection of God's presence and authority, found in passages such as the Ark of the Covenant being brought to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6) and Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1-11).",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses is \"Zion\" or Jerusalem. Throughout the Bible, Zion symbolizes the dwelling place of God and the ultimate destination of His people. It represents the promised land and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Examples of this development can be seen in Psalms, where Zion is celebrated as the holy city, and in the book of Revelation, where it is depicted as the New Jerusalem.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the \"tree of life.\" In Genesis, the tree of life represents immortality and access to God's presence (Genesis 2:9). In Revelation, the tree of life is a symbol of eternal life and is found in the New Jerusalem, accessible to those who have washed their robes (Revelation 22:14). The development of this symbol shows humanity's longing for eternal life and restoration of communion with God. (58 words)",

    "Summarize1": "Psalm 24 declares that the earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord. It asks who can approach the Lord and states that those with clean hands and pure hearts will be blessed. It exalts the King of glory, describing the Lord as strong, mighty, and victorious.",
    "Summarize2": "In Isaiah 33:17-22, it is prophesied that people will see the king in his beauty and a distant land. They will no longer see arrogant and incomprehensible people. The city of Zion, Jerusalem, will be a peaceful, unmovable place where the Lord will be their Mighty One. The Lord is their judge, lawgiver, and king who will save them.",
    "Summarize3": "In these verses, John falls down to worship an angel who showed him these things, but the angel tells him to worship God instead. The angel also says that the time is near and encourages people to continue in their actions, whether good or evil. Jesus then declares that He is coming soon and will reward each person according to their deeds. Those who wash their robes will have access to the tree of life, while those who practice evil will be kept outside. Jesus also warns against adding or taking away from the prophecy, and closes by affirming that He is coming soon and praying for God's grace to be with His people.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 24 was likely written during King David's reign in Israel, around 1010 to 970 BCE. This was a time of political and military expansion for Israel, with David defeating enemies and establishing Jerusalem as the capital. The psalm reflects David's faith in God as sovereign and emphasizes the need for purity and righteousness in approaching Him. It expresses a desire for God's blessing and the presence of the King of glory.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage takes place in Judah during King Hezekiah's reign, where the Assyrian Empire is a threat. Judah is fearful and longs for a righteous ruler who will bring peace and protection from enemies.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The verses from the Book of Revelation, written by John of Patmos in the late 1st century AD, address the challenges faced by the early Christian community in the Roman Empire. Christians were persecuted and pressured to conform to societal norms, including the worship of the Roman emperor. The book reflects the political and social uncertainty of the time, with the tyrannical rule of Emperor Domitian and ongoing conflicts. It contains apocalyptic imagery, discussing spiritual warfare and the ultimate victory of God over evil, while encouraging believers to remain faithful.",
