Contemporary psychology research has found that religious beliefs and practices, such as belief in a higher power and faithfulness to religious teachings, can have positive effects on mental health and well-being.

Studies have shown that religious individuals often experience lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and report higher levels of life satisfaction and social support. Conversion experiences have been associated with enhanced psychological resilience and a sense of purpose, as individuals turn away from negative behaviors and embrace a new set of beliefs and values (e.g., Koenig, 2012; Francis et al., 2013).

This process is initiated by signaling pathways that sense liver injury and coordinate cell cycle re-entry and proliferation. Through this mechanism, the liver can regain its original functionality and restore homeostasis.\n\nResearch sources:\n1. Michalopoulos, G. K. (2010). Liver regeneration.
