    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the \"rock.\" It symbolizes stability, strength, and a firm foundation. Examples of how it develops throughout the Bible include God as the \"rock\" in Exodus 17:6, the \"rock\" of salvation in Isaiah 26:4, and Jesus as the \"rock\" in 1 Corinthians 10:4. The rock represents God's reliability and steadfastness in providing a secure and unshakable refuge for His people.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the key. In Isaiah 22, the key represents authority and access. It is first mentioned in reference to Shebna's position being taken away and given to Eliakim. In the New Testament, Jesus references this symbol when he says, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 16:19). The key symbolizes the power to open and close, representing God's ultimate authority and control over salvation.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the gospel. The term \"gospel\" refers to the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ and the message of God's grace and redemption. Throughout the Bible, the concept of the gospel develops from the promise of a coming Messiah in the Old Testament to the fulfillment of that promise in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. It teaches about the atonement for sin, resurrection, and eternal life through faith in Jesus. The gospel is central to the Christian faith and is emphasized in various Scriptures throughout the Bible.",

    "Summarize1": "In this psalm, David praises God for rescuing him from a difficult situation. He acknowledges God's faithfulness and proclaims His saving acts to others, expressing his desire to do God's will and live according to His laws. David asks for God's mercy and protection to always be with him.",
    "Summarize2": "God sends a message to Shebna, the palace administrator, warning him of his impending downfall and disgrace. God announces that He will replace him with Eliakim, who will be given authority and honor. However, the peg that symbolizes Eliakim's authority will eventually give way and fall.",
    "Summarize3": "Paul is astonished that the Galatians are turning away from the true gospel and embracing a false one. He emphasizes that even if he, or even an angel, were to preach a different gospel, they should be condemned by God. Paul asserts that his message is not from human origin but from a direct revelation from Jesus Christ Himself. He clarifies that he is not seeking the approval of people but rather of God.",

    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight from external research is that Psalm 40 is seen by some scholars as a Messianic prophecy, with verses 6-8 referring to the coming of Jesus. The phrase \"But my ears you have opened\" is understood as Jesus declaring His obedience to God's will, and the reference to the scroll in verse 7 suggests that the words spoken by Jesus are already written and predetermined.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that it shows Paul's concern about the Galatians turning away from the true gospel and being deceived by false teachers. He emphasizes that even if he or an angel from heaven were to preach a different gospel, it should be rejected. This highlights the importance of remaining faithful to the original teachings of Christ.",

    "SocioSummary1": "Psalm 40 was likely written by King David during his reign in the 10th century BCE. Though it does not mention specific historical events, it is believed to reflect David's personal experiences and his relationship with God. David faced opposition from neighboring nations during this time, such as the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites. The psalm expresses David's trust in the Lord's deliverance and gratitude for being rescued from a desperate situation, likely influenced by the broader context of conflicts and struggles in the region.",
    "SocioSummary2": "Isaiah 22:15-25 was written during the reign of King Hezekiah in the Kingdom of Judah in the 8th century BCE. The passage addresses the political situation in the royal court, condemning the arrogant steward Shebna and predicting his downfall. It also promises the rise of a new leader, Eliakim, who is favored by God and given great authority. The passage reflects the unstable and precarious socio-political context of the time, with external threats from the Assyrian Empire and internal struggles within the kingdom.",
    "SocioSummary3": "Galatia, located in modern-day Turkey, was under Roman rule at the time of Paul's writing of Galatians. The region had a mix of Gauls and indigenous peoples and was influenced by Roman laws and Hellenistic culture. It had a diverse religious landscape, with indigenous traditions, Roman gods, Jewish communities, and the spread of early Christianity. Paul wrote to address distortions of the gospel and the challenges faced by the early Christian community.",
