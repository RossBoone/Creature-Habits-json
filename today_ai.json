    "Common Themes And Application": "- Gratitude and praise to God for his wondrous deeds (Psalm 66:1-12)\n- Remembering and celebrating the great works of God (Psalm 111)\n- Seeking the welfare and prosperity of the city where God has placed us (Jeremiah 29:1, 4-7)\n- The importance of faith and obedience in experiencing God's healing and salvation (2 Kings 5:1-3, 7-15c; Luke 17:11-19)\n- Perseverance and faithfulness in the midst of trials (2 Timothy 2:8-15)",
    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol that recurs throughout the Bible in these verses is the name of God. The name of God is praised and glorified (Psalm 66:2), and it is associated with the awesome deeds and power of God (Psalm 66:3). It is through the name of God that God's works are remembered and celebrated (Psalm 111:4). The name of God represents his character, faithfulness, and covenant with his people (Psalm 111:9). This symbol develops throughout the Bible as it becomes associated with salvation, worship, and the revelation of God's nature.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The recurring symbol in these verses is the concept of exile or being carried away from one's homeland. This symbol develops throughout the Bible to represent not only physical displacement but also spiritual separation from God due to sin. Examples of this symbol can be seen in the Israelites' exile to Babylon in Jeremiah 29:1-7 and in Naaman's exile from Israel due to leprosy in 2 Kings 5:1-15c. Both situations depict individuals being removed from their rightful place and seeking restoration and redemption.",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the symbol of faithfulness. In this passage, Paul speaks of Jesus being raised from the dead and emphasizes that even if we are faithless, Jesus remains faithful because He cannot disown Himself. This symbol of faithfulness can be seen throughout the Bible, as God consistently remains faithful to His promises despite mankind's faithlessness.",
    "Symbols4Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the idea of healing. The healing of the ten men with leprosy in this passage is a physical healing, but it also represents a spiritual healing and restoration. This theme of healing develops throughout the Bible with examples such as the healing of the blind, the lame, and the demon-possessed. Ultimately, the ultimate healing is found through faith in Jesus Christ.",
    "Summarize1": "Psalm 66:1-12 and Psalm 111 both express praise and thanksgiving to God for his awesome deeds. The psalms highlight God's power, faithfulness, and redemption of his people. They encourage all to worship and give glory to God.",
    "Summarize2": "In Jeremiah 29:1,4-7, God instructs the exiles in Babylon to settle down, build houses, and seek peace and prosperity in the city. In 2 Kings 5:1-3,7-15c, Naaman, a commander with leprosy, is healed by the prophet Elisha after initially being resistant to following his instructions.",
    "Summarize3": "In this passage, Paul encourages Timothy to remember Jesus Christ and to endure suffering for the sake of spreading the gospel. He reminds Timothy of the trustworthiness of God's promises and warns against engaging in useless quarrels. Instead, Timothy is encouraged to present himself to God as an approved worker who handles the word of truth correctly.",
    "Summarize4": "Jesus encounters ten men with leprosy and instructs them to show themselves to the priests. As they go, they are healed. Only one, a Samaritan, returns to give thanks to Jesus, and Jesus commends him for his faith.",
    "Behindinsights1": "One interesting insight about these passages is that they both emphasize the greatness and power of God's deeds. In Psalm 66, it mentions how God turned the sea into dry land and brought the people through water, while in Psalm 111, it talks about the power of God's works in giving His people the lands of other nations. This highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to do amazing things.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight from external research is that this passage is part of a letter written by the apostle Paul to Timothy, his disciple and a young leader in the early Christian church. Paul is encouraging Timothy to remain faithful to the gospel and to persevere in the face of suffering and false teachings. Additionally, scholars often interpret these verses as emphasizing the importance of theological and moral integrity in Christian leadership.",
    "Behind insights 4": "One interesting insight is that the man who came back to thank Jesus and praise God for his healing was a Samaritan. This is significant because Samaritans were often looked down upon by Jews, yet this Samaritan was the only one who showed gratitude. This highlights the theme of faith and gratitude transcending cultural and religious barriers.",
    "SocioSummary1": "The Psalms were likely written during the Iron Age, specifically during the Davidic and Solomonic kingdoms, which would be around the 10th to 6th century BCE. The region of the Levant, including modern-day Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria, was characterized by political and religious upheaval during this time. The Israelites faced conflict with neighboring nations and experienced periods of instability and political changes. The Psalms reflect the experiences of the Israelites during these turbulent times, expressing a range of emotions and seeking divine intervention.",
    "SocioSummary2": "These passages from Jeremiah 29 and 2 Kings 5 were written during the Babylonian exile of the Israelites and highlight the socio-political context of that time. Jeremiah's letter advises the exiles to establish their lives in Babylon, reflecting their struggle to adapt to their new circumstances. The story of Naaman demonstrates the tension and rivalry between different nations, specifically Israel and Aram. This context emphasizes the dynamics and beliefs of different nations during the exile period.",
    "SocioSummary3": "The letter of 2 Timothy was written by Paul to Timothy during a time of persecution and internal disputes in the early Christian church. Christians faced opposition from Jewish authorities and the Roman government, and false teachers were promoting incorrect doctrines and causing divisions. Paul encourages Timothy to stay firm in the core truths of the gospel and warns against getting involved in meaningless arguments and quarrels. The letter reflects the socio-historical challenges faced by the early Christian community.",
    "SocioSummary4": "During Jesus' time, Samaria was populated by Samaritans who were seen as unorthodox and impure by the Jews. Galilee had a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations, with Jewish religious practice influenced by Hellenistic culture. Jesus' encounter with ten men with leprosy, one of whom was a Samaritan, challenges social and religious expectations and highlights the unexpected faith and gratitude of a marginalized group. This story emphasizes the universality of God's mercy and the importance of gratitude and faith.",
    "Scene1": "The scene from the movie \"The Lion King\" where Simba ascends Pride Rock and takes his place as king, while all the animals of the Pride Lands bow down and sing praise to him, is similar to this passage. It captures the joy, awe, and praise towards a powerful and majestic figure (in this case, Simba).",
    "scenelink1": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+lion+king+simba+ascends+pride+rock",
    "Scene2": "The scene from the movie \"Up\" where Carl, the protagonist, receives a letter from Paradise Falls, encouraging him to explore and seek new adventures, is similar to this passage. The letter to the exiles in Jeremiah 29:1,4-7 encourages the exiles to settle down, build houses, marry, and seek the peace and prosperity of the city they are in. Both passages emphasize the idea of finding purpose and making the best of one's current situation.",
    "scenelink2": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Up+movie+Carl+receives+a+letter+from+Paradise+Falls",
    "Scene3": "The scene from a movie that is similar to this passage is from the film \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" when Aragorn, the rightful king, is rallying his troops before the Battle of the Black Gate. He reminds them of their purpose, encourages them to endure, and emphasizes the importance of staying true to their cause, just like the passage urges believers to remain faithful and handle the word of truth correctly.",

Please, be aware!\"\n\nWith words of grace, the Healer spoke,\n\"Go to the priests,\" like sacred yoke.\nAnd as they turned to follow His command,\nTheir bodies healed by Divine hand.\n\nBut one, a stranger, foreign-born,\nWith heart unburdened, soul adorned,\nReturned to thank, his voice resounds,\nIn loud praises, his gratitude abounds.\n\nJesus wondered, with tender plea,\n\"Where are the others?

    "psychology1": "One theme from these texts is the power and awesomeness of God. This theme can be seen in contemporary psychology research on the effects of awe on well-being. Studies have shown that experiences of awe, such as encountering nature or engaging in spiritual practices, can lead to increased positive emotions, improved mental health, and greater life satisfaction. These findings suggest that recognizing and appreciating something greater than ourselves can have profound effects on our well-being. (Research sources: Shiota, M. N., Keltner, D., & Mossman, A.

    "psychology2": "One theme from this text that can be applied to findings in contemporary psychology research is the importance of adaptation and resilience in the face of adversity. Both the letter to the exiles and the story of Naaman emphasize the need to settle, build, and seek peace in challenging situations. Research has shown that individuals who can adapt and find ways to thrive in difficult circumstances tend to have better mental health outcomes. This highlights the importance of resilience as a protective factor in psychological well-being. (Research sources needed)",
    "psychology3": "One theme from this text is the importance of remaining faithful to one's beliefs and values, even in the face of suffering or opposition. This theme can be related to findings in contemporary psychology research on resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. Studies show that individuals who are able to maintain their faith and beliefs in challenging circumstances are more likely to experience better mental health outcomes and greater overall well-being (Source: Park, C. L. (2013). Finding meaning in the face of suffering: Theory, research, and practice. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 69(8), 755-767).",
    "psychology4": "Gratitude and the power of expressing gratitude towards others is a theme in this text. In contemporary psychology research, gratitude has been shown to have positive effects on mental health and well-being. Studies have found that expressing gratitude can increase happiness, reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, improve relationships, and promote better physical health. It is important to cultivate gratitude as a psychological practice for overall well-being. (Research sources: Emmons, R. A., & McCullough, M. E. (2003).

Just as Naaman found healing by washing in the Jordan river, scientists have discovered that soil harbors a vast array of antibiotic-producing bacteria, which have become the basis for the development of numerous life-saving drugs. This highlights the importance of exploring diverse environments and organisms for potential therapeutic interventions.",
    "biology3": "The theme of remaining faithful even in the face of suffering and adversity can be applied to the scientific finding of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Despite the challenges posed by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, scientists continue to search for new ways to combat drug-resistant bacteria and develop alternative treatment options, such as phage therapy or CRISPR technology. They remain faithful to their goal of finding solutions to this pressing problem, even when faced with setbacks or obstacles.\n\nResearch sources:\n1. Ventola, C. L. (2015).
