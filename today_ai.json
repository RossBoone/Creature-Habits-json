    "Symbols1Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the metaphor of God as a Rock. This symbol represents God's strength, protection, and stability. It is seen in verses like Psalm 18:2 - \"The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.\" Throughout the Bible, this symbol develops to emphasize God's unwavering steadfastness and reliability in times of trouble.",
    "Symbols2Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the symbol of leprosy. In this passage, the Lord afflicts King Azariah with leprosy as a consequence for his disobedience. Leprosy appears as a symbol of impurity, judgment, and separation from God in various passages throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Miriam (Numbers 12) and in the healing of Naaman (2 Kings 5).",
    "Symbols3Summarize": "The most important symbol in these verses that recurs throughout the Bible is the kingdom of heaven. It is mentioned in verse 7, where Jesus instructs the disciples to proclaim that it has come near. Throughout the Bible, the symbol of the kingdom of heaven develops to represent God's rule and reign, salvation, eternal life, and the fulfillment of God's promises. It is a central theme found in parables, teachings, and prophecies.",

    "Summarize1": "In Psalm 61, David cries out to God asking for His help and guidance. He declares that God has been his refuge and strong tower. David desires to dwell in God's presence forever and asks for the king's life to be prolonged. He promises to praise God's name and fulfill his vows.",
    "Summarize2": "Azariah became the king of Judah at the age of sixteen and reigned for fifty-two years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but did not remove the high places where sacrifices were made. The Lord afflicted him with leprosy, and he lived in a separate house until his death. Jotham, his son, then became the king.",
    "Summarize3": "Jesus sends out his twelve disciples with specific instructions. They are to go to the lost sheep of Israel and proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is near. They are also given the power to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, and drive out demons. They are told not to bring any material possessions but to rely on the hospitality of others. They are to stay in the homes of worthy individuals and leave those who do not welcome them. Jesus warns that those who reject them will face harsh judgment.",

    "Behindinsights1": "The passage is a psalm written by David, expressing his cry to God for help and his longing to dwell in God's presence. It also includes a prayer for the increase of the king's life and for God's love and faithfulness to protect him. This psalm is often interpreted as a plea for spiritual guidance and divine protection in times of distress.",
    "Behindinsights2": "",
    "Behindinsights3": "One interesting insight about this passage is that Jesus instructs his disciples to focus their ministry on the lost sheep of Israel and not to go among the Gentiles or Samaritans. This shows that in the early stages of Jesus' ministry, his primary mission was to the Jewish people. However, later in the New Testament, the scope of Jesus' message expands to include all people, regardless of their ethnicity or background.",

    "SocioSummary1": "The passage, believed to be written by David, does not provide specific historical context. However, it is generally accepted that David lived in ancient Israel during the 10th century BCE. Israel was a kingdom ruled by David and his successors at that time. The larger Middle East region was characterized by political, cultural, and military interactions among various kingdoms and empires like the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. There were shifting alliances and conflicts during this period.",
    "SocioSummary2": "The passage discusses the reign of Azariah (Uzziah) in the kingdom of Judah. Azariah became king at a young age and ruled for 52 years. He followed God's commands but did not remove the high places where sacrifices were made. As a consequence, God afflicted Azariah with leprosy, and he lived in isolation until his death. After that, Jotham, Azariah's son, became the next king.",
    "SocioSummary3": "During the time of this passage, there were clear divisions between Gentiles and Jews. The passage also highlights tensions between Jews and Samaritans, and the socio-economic factors influenced the instructions given to the disciples by Jesus.",

    "psychology1": "One theme from this text is seeking refuge in God during times of distress. Contemporary psychology research supports the idea that religion and spirituality can provide individuals with a sense of comfort, resilience, and meaning amidst life challenges. For example, studies have found that religious coping strategies are associated with lower levels of depression and greater emotional well-being (Koenig, King, & Carson, 2012; Smith et al., 2003).",
    "psychology2": "One possible theme in this text is the correlation between actions and consequences. Azariah, the king of Judah, is described as doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, yet he did not remove the high places where sacrifices and incense were offered. As a consequence, the Lord afflicted him with leprosy until the day he died. This theme of actions leading to consequences can be paralleled to findings in contemporary psychology research, such as the study of behavioral reinforcement and punishment.",
    "psychology3": "Theme: Cultural/Social Identity and In-group Bias\n\nContemporary psychology research supports the theme of cultural/social identity and in-group bias found in Matthew 10:5-15. Studies have shown that individuals tend to favor their own social or cultural group, showing a bias towards \"in-group\" members compared to \"out-group\" members. This bias can influence behavior, attitudes, and decision-making, leading to favoritism and exclusion. Understanding this phenomenon can help in promoting inclusivity and reducing discrimination based on cultural or social identities. (Source: Tajfel, H., & Turner, J. C. (1986).
