    "excerpt": "Sammy was an over-eager little pre-teen. He was always the first to blurt something out in a group. What he said would rarely be what others would consider \"cool,\" but it was always very Sammy.\n\nHis father was a famous blogger. He had been a very popular pastor until his wife had gotten breast cancer. The ensuing fight against the disease took so much out of him that he resigned from pastorship. And when his wife passed, because of his grief, he resigned from just about everything else. \n\nThe one thing he found delight in was his son Sammy. He had started blogging about the cute things Sammy had done since he was a baby. His father saw how unique his boy was from early on, and just delighted in him so much. Everything Sammy did was so Sammy. And all of his old parishioners and friends that didn't get to see him anymore loved reading the delight his son's antics brought his sorrowful soul. \n\nSammy had said multiple times that he was totally cool about whatever his dad wanted to write about him to his dad's friends, but Sammy had no idea he was such a sensation to his father. He just saw how his peers saw him. He came home from school every day beaten down . . . for being himself. \n\n\"Hey, Buddy, how was school?\" His dad said as he greeted him at the door. He handed Sammy a sandwich and Sammy took a big bite with a sigh. \n\n\"It was a work of art, Daddyo,\"...",
