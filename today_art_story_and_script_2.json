    "Artist Statement 1": "We rage when our life isn't fair. We blame when others get more breaks than we do. \n\nBut what type of life would you rather live, really? One where everything is given to you and you are known as someone who generally has things work out for themselves easily? Or one who has put in the hard work and endured resistance, but overcome. Even if you didn't get the job everyone vies for, or the hottest spouse, or a million followers, do your people tell stories about you that show unusual integrity, and grit, and have pushed through adversity in a way that inspires others to live like that.\n\nWhen we live like that, we usually do have breaks come our way, but they're not always the ones you would expect. \n\nBut that's what makes stories great. There is the reward, but it is different than we expected. And once we see it, it is very good. And we hope it will put us in a light that will be a beacon for others to learn from and also inspired to live with character like ours.",

    "excerpt": "Cursed is the man\nwho churches every Sunday and Wednesday.\nWho puts always 10% in the plate.\nWho never drinks or smokes.\nWhose Double Windsor is the envy of the other elders.\nWho holds staunchly to straight, republican virtues\nand locks his heavy doors at night\nso his entertainment center\nwill not be stolen.\nHe has insulated himself from his fears for so long\nthat he can no longer cry.\nBut constantly bites at his family in anger\nwhen anything threatens\nto wake up such uncertainty.\n\nBlessed is the man\nwho goes to AA meetings\ndespite who he knows will find out.\nWho dearly loves the daughter he had out of wedlock\nand still opens the door to the clinic for her\nbecause she swore she'd abort it on her own.\nWho battles daily against a family tree of self-destruction\nAnd knows he has only one hope.\nAnd who offered his bed to the freezing vagabond\nThat approached him on the street last night.\nBut now he cries deeply, slumped against his dresser\nbecause this morning he woke\nAnd found his mother's ring stolen,\nAnd because he knows\neven more will be taken\nAnd it will not stop until God opens wide all his doors\nand cleans out his whole heart.\n\nRaw Spoon",
