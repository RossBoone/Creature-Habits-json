    "excerpt": "This was the story of her dream:\n\nI was pounding his chest with a bat, trying to break open his heart. He had hurt me so much, I had to show him my pain and everything he had taken from me. But his heart was stone. Cold and solid stone. And although I hit his chest with all the strength I had, until my arms burned and my breath was hoarse, I could not even get through his chest to touch his heart. He could not feel me. It was hopeless.\n\nI hated him. I could not make him feel all the pain he had left me with.\n\nAnd I could not stop.\n\nBut then I heard a voice. \"Stop, Sarah.\"\n\n\"No!\" My voice was ragged with tears and anger, \"He doesn't know how much he hurt me! It's not fair!\" ...",
