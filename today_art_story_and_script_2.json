    "excerpt": "Bennie was a Psychiatrist at Grady hospital when COVID-19 hit. She was black and round, with hair buzzed close to her head. And she had an abnormal prayer life. She saw things others didn't see. She got messages sometimes that she didn't want. In other cultures she would have been a great witchdoctor. If she weren't raised Christian, she'd probably fall into being a psychic because it seemed the dead could communicate through her.\n\nInstead of being a psychic, she became a psychiatrist. And like was said before, she was a psychiatrist with an an unusual prayer life.\n\nIt was near the end of her 28 hour shift, on Wednesday at 3pm that it happened. She had just finished her rounds, and was so discouraged. They had 14 deaths that day, 12 of them directly from COVID. And it looked like there might be another one tonight. This was the worst day any Atlanta hospital had had in the epidemic so far. \n\nShe closed the door of her office and sat down. She slid her N95 mask off her mouth and down to her neck. She pushed up her glasses and rubbed her eyes. A whisper slipped from her mouth, \"Why all this, god?\" Her mind quickly drifted toward sleep.\n\nBut suddenly a woman stood there with her, just inside the door. But there had been no creak or click. She had a smile on her face. Her shoulder-length, white hair gleamed. Her arms were crossed and feet planted. Maybe 45? Bennie didn't know her. . . she didn't think.\n\n\"Bennie.\" The woman said. \n\n\"Leslie!?\" Bennie suddenly did recognize her. \"What--?! What are you--?\" She fell silent.\n\n\"I came to talk to you, and show you some things.\"\n\n(see more at link above)",
