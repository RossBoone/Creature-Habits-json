    "excerpt": "Stanley was a bummer of a name for a stutterer. He was made fun of all through school, and so he didn't like people much. After school, hez fell into a shady online job where he stayed in his apartment and basically sold useless insurance to the elderly. He had made a habit of looking at some pretty shady sites, and movies, and he let his body indulge in its desires. His hair and clothes were greasy, his posture slumped, and his blood pressure high. \n\nWhen he did have to talk, he had to think through his words very wisely beforehand because sometimes people had to wait 30 seconds for them to come out. He was practicing his words while walking through a park one day, when he bumped into a tripod holding a light for a film set. Everyone looked over for a second until Stanley caught, and secured the light again. He tried to disappear as he stuttered a \"S-S-S----orry.\"\n\nThey all looked back to what they were doing, except the person who was being filmed. It was a middle aged, leather-faced man with a salt and peppered beard, sitting on a park bench facing the camera. \"Wait!\" He called. Stanley tried to ignore and slip away. The leather-faced man caught up to him and said, \"My friend, I know how to make your life better.\"\n\nStanley tried to duck away again but the man got in front of him. \"Look,\" He continued in something like a Brazilian accent, \"I escaped a POW camp and was lost in the Amazon jungle for 12 years where God spoke to me and helped me become better. I recognize something in you that was in me.\"\n\nStanley paused and looked at him. The man's blue eyes arrested Stanley. He was chiseled and built well. Every hair in his beard was in place. His skin was bright and healthy.\n\n\"I'm Sarasota Campbell. Can we sit down somewhere. No judgment. I want to help.\"\n\nStanley looked back at the film crew. Sarasota interjected, \"It was them who reached out to me. I can pause the filming if I want. Let's just sit down around the corner. I won't take much time, unless you want to.\"  ...\n",
