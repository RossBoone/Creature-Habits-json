    "excerpt": "I think we focus a lot on God's love for us, His forgiveness, and our belief in Him that will save us. And maybe that's because not believing all those things is the source of many of our problems -- our insecurities and paralyzing fear's. But I don't think just believing that stuff is the majority of the story. We can be loved and forgiven and believe well, but that just gives us the safe foundation to try hard things and fail. I think maybe God says, \"Of course I need you to understand that stuff. But now I need you to get to work with the hard task of loving people well. That is what I made you for.\"\n\nRaw Spoon, 10-25-17",
