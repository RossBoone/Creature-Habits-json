    "excerpt": "So, last night at church I was convicted that even though I try to read the Bible, my \n\nattitude is bad. I usually read it skeptically and often let myself get upset because God doesn't act the way I think He should act. But I keep reading it because it's what I've been asked to do, I grumble at God because I'm doing my part and He's not doing His, and I curmudgeonly carry on.\n\nSo it was frustrating today when I read the story of Balaam, and it seemed God was acting dumb. AGAIN! How can I not have a bad attitude when he does stuff like this:\n\nHe tells Balaam to go somewhere but along the way an angel appears in his path and now tells him to stop. But only his donkey sees the angel in front of them and veers away. Balaam beats his donkey for stopping. This happens three times and after the last time Donkey turns to him and says, \"What the heck are you doing, dude? Don't you know me well enough to know I don't usually do this? Can't you see something must be wrong?\"\n\nIt doesn't seem to surprise Balaam that his donkey can suddenly talk and Balaam replies, \"You've made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I'd kill you right now!\"\n\nThen the angel becomes visible to Balaam and he does have a sword and says \"I'm ticked, and if it weren't for your donkey turning away I would have impaled you, buddy.\"\n\nSo, this makes me, Ross, mad. God told him in the first place to go, then stands in his way because he's mad that he's going. Then expects him to understand that He's mad, even though he's invisible. What the heck, God!? Are you so fickle? Look, I'm trying to trust you here but you won't stop doing stuff like this!...",
