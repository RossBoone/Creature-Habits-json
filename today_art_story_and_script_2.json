    "excerpt": "Little Tremor opened his groggy eyes. Where was he? It felt like his whiskers had been pressed into the moist dirt for a long time. His little incisors were resting directly in the dirt. He tasted clotted blood and one of his teeth was missing. He remembered how he and his brother had fought about something and his brother had kicked him in the mouth with his strong hind legs and left him there. He looked at the sun trying to reach him through the trees. Maybe he'd been here a day or two now?\n\nHe lifted his head and his ears; why were they so heavy? Everything seemed so heavy.\n\nThe other animals in the forest were still fighting.\n\nHad it always been like this? No. The birds used to chirp instead of scream. The bears used to burrow and not bully. The squirrels didn't used to constantly screech and scrape at each other up and down the trees. Something had taken the whole bright side of the mountain and turned them against each other.\n\nHe pushed up to his feet and hopped to the nearest tree. That was not far enough; commotion still surrounded him. He could hear the arguments in little holes and burrows. A snake slithered out from a bush by him and he jumped back. \"Jitter!\" He called to the snake. But Tremor quickly stopped himself from saying more. Jitter was obviously beyond himself. Hissing something about \"Those closed tunnel supporters are complete idiots, so blinded by their selfishness.\"\n\nBut it looked like Jitter was one of the blind ones. In fact, Tremor realized, everyone looked like this these days. Eyelids so low it was almost like they were asleep, and they had forgotten wisdom and patience, and faith in the wake of all the fear and anger felt in night mares. It was like a spell, infinitely stuck in a dream. How had they gotten here?...\n",
