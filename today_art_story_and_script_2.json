    "excerpt": "In the Psalms, David gushes over and over about how he loves the laws of God. He almost talks about it like each rule is a new intoxicating lover given to him for his harem.\n\nAnd that sounds weird to me. Loving boring old rules like that?\n\nBut the more I thought about it, it describes what I've experienced pretty well!\n\nAs I have obeyed God's momentary instructions, like obeying the nudge that says it's time to stop working, or to stay quiet just a little longer despite the awkward silence in small group prayer time, some really cool things seem to happen.\n\nMy day is markedly more satisfying when I stop doing the work I really want to get done but just wont, and when I stayed quiet in prayer last week, the guy who rarely speaks up prayed a really beautiful, heartfelt prayer over an oft-neglected person in our group.\n\nAnd I feel like there are instances like this all around me every day if I'd only started remembering them.\n\nSo if I start gathering these memories of obediences and their rewards, I presume it could start to look like our God is wooing and loving us with them, revealing new parts of himself, even as he makes us into better lovers, ourselves.\n\nAnd maybe this delight is a glimpse of the intoxicating love he knows we can feel when we know him and his heart better, his heart more naked, closer to, and for us\n\nRaw Spoon, 2-27-13",
