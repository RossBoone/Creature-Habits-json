    "Artist Statement 1": "When a \"man after God's own heart\" sinned in a major way, he felt regret and asked God to forgive him. No matter what you've done you can change your heart on the matter and he will receive you back. Where do you see death in this image and where do you see life? \n\nWhen our heart feels dry and dirty, being surrounded in the spirit brings back life, our color and even if our whole life isn't brought back to full color right away, we will start to bear fruit, even from the dry branches.",

    "excerpt": "James K. A. Smith says doing the good thing is doing the beautiful thing.\n\nI hit a wall when I ask myself, what is the good thing I should be doing better, because I feel like most things I do in my life are pretty good. I don't like beat children or scam people for their money. It's hard to really think of anything I should stop or start doing. After I come out of most sermons I don't really know anything to change, but I feel like I should somehow be doing something better.\n\nBut after reading James K.A. Smith I paused asking what good thing I should be doing, and instead I asked myself, \"what beautiful thing could I be doing?\"\n\nAnd then I started thinking of all sorts of inspiring things that would be the stuff of beautiful stories. Like throwing an extravagant party for a homeless friend's birthday, or inviting my neighbors over for a wonderful dinner. Or like giving $50 to a single mom that seems to he struggling. Stuff like that.\n\nThen I see a lot of very good things I could be doing, and this type of good is exciting and compelling and I want to do it, because it's just so beautiful.\n\nRaw Spoon, 12-5-18",
