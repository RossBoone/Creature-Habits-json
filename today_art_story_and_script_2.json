    "Artist Statement 1": "When it seems all others in this world have left you behind, and your vices seem to be stronger than all the will you can possibly mount against them, there is one who is waiting for you in that space. \n\nPeople often say rock bottom was where they found full transformation. In fact transformation couldn't happen until they had come fully to the end of themselves. \n\nIf you feel yourself falling, and hope is trickling away, all people leaving you behind, be ready for one person waiting for you in the place where all others have left long ago you.\n\nHe is there because he loves and wants to rescue you. Your answer to your problems is to surrender your will to Him. Sometimes it just takes us coming to the total bottom of ourselves. And He knows that.",

    "excerpt": "Your word that releases rolling hills of forests\nFrom a tiny dried up seed,\nAnd fills the earth with abundant fresh air for us--\nAn impressive feat indeed.\n\nYour word that takes a writhing worm,\nPulls apart its pieces in a shell\nTo emerge with painted wings and forms\nYour power to change, an impressive sell\nSo, cannot that prodigious word, \nReach a single quiet space and start\nto shift invisible instincts\nIn this one, sinful heart. \n\n***\n\nRoss, climb this mountain with fiery plume\nLearn every moment to surrender\n\"You are my servant, Israel, in whom \nI will display my splendor\"\n\n(from Isaiah 49:3)",
