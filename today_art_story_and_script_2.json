    "excerpt": "(Continued from yesterday's things that helped with suicidal thoughts) \n\n2. You are LOVED. Even if you don't love yourself, God loves you. \"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us...We love because he first loved us.\" 1 John 4:10,19. You may FEEL like no one loves you or no one cares. Again, you may FEEL like no one loves you. You may have just had a fight with a friend or a family member or just gotten a divorce. You may feel that you don't have any friends or haven't found a significant other. But God loves you more than anyone could ever love you. God ALWAYS loves you. \"Give thanks to the Lord for his love endures forever.\" 2 Chronicles 20:21. This may sound obvious, but God does NOT want you to end your life! He will NEVER STOP LOVING YOU no matter what you've said, felt, thought, or done. No matter what your situation is, God is there. He will \"never leave you nor forsake you.\" Joshua 1:5. You may feel that you've made a horrible mistake and that no one will forgive you or that you cannot forgive yourself. But God will ALWAYS forgive you (1 John 1:9). Don't give up on yourself because God will NEVER give up on you. You are loved.\n\n(continued tomorrow)",
