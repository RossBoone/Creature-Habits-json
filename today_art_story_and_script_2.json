    "excerpt": "C.S. Lewis wrote:\n\n\"Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal.\"\nI was home for thanksgiving and my family has a couple of Golden retrievers, named Gracie and Cricket.\n\nGracie is a good dog. She's loving and cuddly, and mostly obedient, she's like 12 and yet super healthy, we don't need a leash to run with her, and she's super smart; like, she knows how to open doors and stuff.\n\nCricket on the other hand is sloppy, clumsy, dumb, stubborn and unruly. Young and already has medical problems. She's fat and out of shape so I have to almost drag her, with a leash, when trying to run with her.\n\n\nWhen we're in the house we have to keep them behind a baby fence because Cricket will get into everything. A couple days ago I heard Gracie pick the lock of their little baby fence and they both came panting out to join us in whatever it was that was so irresistible they needed to be there. But Cricket went straight for the cat bowl and ate all of Stampy's food.\n\nNO! Both of you, BACK INTO YOUR ROOM! Cricket had ruined it for us all...",
