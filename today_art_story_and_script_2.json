    "excerpt": "Allie pined in her bedroom for love. A very specific love named Jonathan Tillman from her PE class. He also happened to be her friend Jenny's brother. \n\nAllie sat in front of her mirror trying out new makeup, praying, \"God I've been waiting this whole semester for Jonathan to notice me.\" She tried on her new tank top and platform sandals and posed in the mirror. \"God, I felt like you promised me I'd have a boyfriend before I graduated high school.\"\n\nShe sat down and picked up a locket. She closed the chain's clasp around her neck and opened the metal heart hanging from it. \"God why do I have to wait so long for this? All I want is to have Jonathan in this heart next to mine. I would love him so well.\" \n\nShe had kind of accidentally taken the locket from Jenny about a year ago when she was at her house. They were trying on jewelry and she had sort of just forgotten to take it off. But she had not tried very hard to give it back. She should probably give it back to Jenny soon. It was just a cheap thing, probably from the mall. But it made Allie feel closer to Jonathan, Jenny's brother. \n\n***\nJonathan sat next to his sister, Jenny on her bed. She held her head in her hands and said, \"I just don't know where it went, Jonathan. I feel like I'm dishonoring mom. That was the last thing she gave me before she died. How bad am I that I've lost it?\"\n\nJonathan asked, \"Do you think one of your friends took it? If anyone took mom's locket I don't know what I'll do to them but--\"\n\n\"Maybe. I don't think any of them would take it on purpose, though. But even if they did, if they just brought it to me now I'd just be grateful to have it back.\"\n\n\"I would too. That's all they'd need to do, and I'd be totally cool with it too. But if they're willingly keeping it, that person is dead to me.\"\n\n---\n\n2 Peter 3:9 says \"The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to know repentance.\"\n\nPerhaps God's slowness is not because he wants to hold back the promises he has given you, but instead a merciful waiting for your repentance so he can make good on what he wants to give you.
