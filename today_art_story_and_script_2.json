    "Artist Statement 1": "We often wish that we wanted God more, but what if what we surround ourselves with influences our desire? Do you watch a lot of YouTube? Does it make you want to watch more? Do you give pleasure to yourself in different ways, which just make you want those things more? What if we spent more time with God, appreciating the peace and the slow and calming reset. Would we begin to want more of it? Would we ever want it more than the much louder pleasures? Why don't we try.",

    "excerpt": "What if the vibration that gave shape and frequency to all atoms in the universe, that we call the \"big bang,\" was literally a voice. A vibration bigger than any language but encompassed all of them.\n\nAnd what if the voice from the Bible that spoke all creation into existence was literally a vibration emanating from a single place, and it was so immediate and loud that it gave shape and tones, like notes in an almost infinitely faceted song, to every element in the universe, very much like what we think of as the \"big bang.\"\n\nRaw Spoon, 10-25-18\n",
