    "Artist Statement 1": "We are tempted to manipulate people using their feelings. Make them scared we'll be rude if they respond like that again, or punish them with our tone when they don't do things like we want them to be done around the house. You can threaten to take their phone away if they keep coming home late. That actually might be called for.\n\nBut the right thing to do, especially if they are not your next of kin, is to compassionately present your hopes for them, tell them your concerns or needs, often if needed, but then let them make their decisions knowing you have both of your bests in mind.  \n\nAnd trust God to do a work in them without us bending our character to be the type that controls or forces (esp to those closest to us) to do what we want will be better for us.

Please be inspired by these modern day \"Acts\" and lets go out and live our faith today!\n\nThis is the story of one of the members in Breathe:\n\n\"I designate a certain percentage of my paycheck to go toward charities.  I had not done my budget for quite a while and so i had a lot of money to give. \n\nOne of the girls in the youth group i help out at was in a car accident in which her friend died.  I heard one of the prayer requests last Sunday was that they didn't know how they were going to get around because their other car was in the shop. \n\nLater that day I took a check for $602 to the older daughter in the family and said to use it to get a car up and going so their dad could go to work.  I told her that i trusted her to cash the check and give it to her parents and to not say who had given it to her.  And then i left.\n\nA few days later I asked her if it got put to good use.  She told me that she just gave it to her parents because she didn't have a checking account, but that there wasn't a problem.  They could still get the money, she said.\n\nA few days after that i went to a high school choir performance and st...",
