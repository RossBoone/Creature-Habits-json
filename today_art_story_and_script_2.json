    "excerpt": "I was sitting with someone who is a little bit hard to love. They talked and talked and I felt like I had better places to be.\n\nBut I recognized the feeling is the same when I'm trying to do pull-ups or when I'm on the last leg of the run. And maybe that's because in the same way my body needs training to get stronger, the soul needs training to love more.\n\nNext time I want to roll my eyes and tell someone sorry I have to go, maybe I can hunker down like it's one more set, or one more lap, and think of it as heart training to be fit for heaven.\n\nRaw Spoon, 10-16-17",
