    "Artist Statement 1": "The God of the universe obviously isn't an old white man, but this image flashed into my mind one day and after I made it, I gave it that name because it it looks like what popular culture sometimes uses to represent God. Within his beard is contained many aspects of this full and rich world. -Raw Spoon",

    "excerpt": "When I sincerely pray for something, and it absolutely does not come true, I begin to ask myself, 'are we just fooling ourselves?'\n\nI have two options at that point. I can say, 'God must not be real,' or I can say 'God must not work in the ways I expect him to work.'\n\nWhen I watch the breathtaking machine that is a firefly at dusk, or recognize the golden spiral in a chambered nautilus, or glimpse the harmony with which the intricate systems in our bodies play together, I tend to lean towards the latter option; His ways are more mysterious than mine.\n\nRaw Spoon",
