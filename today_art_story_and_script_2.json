    "Artist Statement 1": "If I make my bed in depression,\n\nYou are there.\n\nIf I make my bed in anxiety,\n\nYou are there.\n\nIf I make my bed in doubt,\n\nYou are there.\n\nIf I make my bed in suffering,\n\nBehold.\n\nYou are there.\n\nThere is no place too deep that your love doesn't go deeper.\n\nIn the pit of my despair,\n\nMay your love be the rope that pulls me up.\n\nFather may you meet me in the depths but never leave me there.\n\nMay your love break the surface of my suffering and may I see the sun once again.\n\nEven if I am drowning on the far side of the sea,\n\nMay your compassion be my wings.\n\nMay my worst nights shine like the best days in your presence.\n\nMay you search the deepest depths in the shipwreck of my heart.\n\nAnd may you find your treasure still.\n\n(Anthony Gurrola)",

    "excerpt": "(continued from previous days' help with suicidal thoughts)\n\n5. Suicidal thinking is often a manifestation of depression, anxiety, and even anger. Don't make decisions when you are in a depressed state of mind. We may feel ANGRY about our situation or even angry at God. \"Why would he EVER allow me to feel this way? He doesn't care about me- he is a cruel God. I want NO PART of this any longer. This is NO WAY to live. It must end NOW -- it has to end NOW. This is TOO MUCH. I can't handle it any longer. There is NO WAY out of this. My only option is to end my life.\" When I am thinking this way, I am not in the right state of mind. I'm using words like NEVER, ALWAYS, FOREVER. This is All or Nothing thinking, which is something I do when I'm not thinking clearly. DO NOT make decisions when you are in a depressed state of mind. Trust others' judgment and even your own judgment when you are feeling well. As the saying goes, \"This, too, shall pass.\"\n\nI hope this has helped you. Remember, sometimes it takes hard work dealing with suicidal thoughts and fighting just to stay alive. I will leave you with one last quote: \"Difficult roads lead to beautiful destinations.\"\n\n***\n\nThank you, Dave for redeeming your struggle in ways that can help others! I value your friendship. And your struggle has in fact helped me with my struggles. I haven't struggled with suicidal ideation, but your journey has born fruit that has helped me with mine.\n\nIf you'd like to get in touch with Dave, I believe that can be arranged. And this would bring me value by being able to make that connection.\n\nRaw Spoon (reposting Dave Saunders' essay on dealing with suicide)\n\n6-1-20",
