    "Artist Statement 1": "In the Old Testament, the god of the Hebrews rocked the world by setting up a model of eye-for-eye, zero sum game. And it was called Justice. But when Jesus came he set up a new cycle. He gave of himself first, sacrificing without any assurance that he would be given anything back. This is the model he calls us to. It puts the giver in a vulnerable situation to be taken advantage of, but this type of justice, the free giving of love, is the type that can change hearts, and catch them on fire with a similar type of unconditional love.",

The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. 2 When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.\n\n3 Then the king asked, \"What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.\"\n\n4 \"If it pleases the king,\" replied Esther, \"let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.\"\n\n5 \"Bring Haman at once,\" the king said, \"so that we may do what Esther asks.\"\n\nSo the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. 6 As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, \"Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.\"\n\n7 Esther replied, \"My petition and my request is this",
