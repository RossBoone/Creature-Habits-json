    "excerpt": "I thought, is it true? Is God's spirit really in me?\nIt feels like it's me, and just me.\n\nI then I thought, he is quiet.\nMaybe sometimes his presence is felt\nin the ancient and universal.\nLike that feeling of the unshakable goodness\nof trees and clean water.\nOr the undeniable conviction of something magical\nin the beauty or uniqueness\nI sometimes feel in the face of a stranger.\nAnd the persistent drive to make something new\nthat is the wind behind my days.\n\nIt is also the small voice, so close and focused on me.\nLike I am one in the dark wondering if anyone is near.\nI have heard no one come or go for hours, years.\nAnd then a voice speaks from right next to me.\nHe is quiet but has been here the whole time.\n\nAnd I wonder if he is wrapped\nin and around moments of all people,\nmost who do not realize it.\nHe is sitting close, watching, speaking just a few seldom words...\nto get up now, or give your food to that person.\n\nTouching us...\nThe settling after a cry.\n\nBathing and caressing us...\nGiving us the hope to try again.\n\nLiving a story of sacrifice as the backdrop to our culture...\nThe whelming of compassion and forgiveness\nWhen all we could bring was a bitter heart.\n\n\nRaw Spoon\n",
