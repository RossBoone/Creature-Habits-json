    "excerpt": "God, I plead have mercy\non my friends who have turned away--\nbecause how can you blame us?\n\nYou gave us Science like a wedding gift\nto know your intimate thoughts,\nbut it's made you seem like a liar.\n\nThe previous generations have spilled Sex\ninto every soaking fold of our nation's fabric\nand You call us sinful for it.\nSo wouldn't you expect us to resent you\nfor the guilt stained into our thighs\nand for our little brothers who say, 'screw it all;\nweren't we made like this?'\n\nOf all the world's handsome leaders\nWe've found none trustworthy to reign supreme\nSo we've made Democracy our god,\n\nWe've placed our faith in Human Rights\nbecause how could we trust a Heavenly Father\nwho sends his children down to die.\n(Like my devout mom who slipped off our roof.)\n\nWe've tried to find you in Religions-\nbut all we know is to switch temples\nlike channels, when we're left wanting\nbecause Television was our teacher.\n\nGod, in You alone I trust-- only You.\nBut can you see now\nhow little we know of what we do?\n\nHave mercy on our soot-laden land, Lord.\nRaise up scientists and artists and politicians\nwho have seen Heaven\nto speak in our dialect about Sex and Science\nand your Sweeping Hand of Mercy.\n\nTrain our eyes and our bravery\nto take up light in fragile lanterns\nthat can gather all our scattered tribes--\nall the skin and sinew from the night--\ninto your Gentle Hands of Mercy,\nGod, I plead.\n\nRaw Spoon\n\n",
