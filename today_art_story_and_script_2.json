    "Artist Statement 1": "What if who we are right now is so much less than who we have the potential to be. Is our head in the dirt? Are we oblivious to what God and others see we can be? God, help us see the true nature of who we are in your world of upside down living. Where first are last and we being weak is where you can show yourself as strong.",

    "excerpt": "Maybe we protest for the immigrant, but do we know our own neighbor?\n\nMaybe we campaign for #BlackLivesMatter, but are we careful not to get caught talking too long to someone who's overweight, or just uncool, even though it's also just a difference of genetics?\n\nAre we becoming brave to call out bigoted language, but still gossip about our own friends?\n\nDo we pride ourselves on promoting women in the work place, but diminish them at home with pornography?\n\nDo we fight for LGBT rights, but criticize our spouse for unusual, though harmless sexual impulses?\n\nDo we like to be seen as warriors for justice but when someone in front of us, with problems far less sensational, could use our attention do we neglect them?\n\nThese questions are as much for myself as for others.\n\nRaw Spoon, 8-26-18\n",
