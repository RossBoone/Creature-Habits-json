Blue was desperate to the point of tears but it was Greg whose head was in his hands. \n\nGreg looked up, \"Hey Blue!\" He sniffed and wiped his eyes. \"I'm always glad to see you. How'd the semester finish up?\" Greg had founded this community, which some people called a cult, 25 years ago. \n\n\"My grades were okay, I guess. Are-- are you okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will be fine in time.
